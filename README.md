# Armory by Anvilogic Forge
## Overview
Welcome to Armory, an open-source initiative by the Anvilogic Forge team. This repository houses public versions of the sophisticated detections found within the real Anvilogic Platform Armory. Our mission is to empower security teams across the globe by providing access to top-tier threat detection methodologies, enhancing cybersecurity measures and fostering a safer digital environment.

## Mission
The Anvilogic Forge team is dedicated to illuminating the dark corners of the web by tracking and responding to invisible threats. By making our detections publicly available, we aim to contribute to the collective defense against the biggest emerging threats in the cybersecurity landscape.

## What's Inside
**Detections**: Find ready-to-use detection rules that span across various categories of cybersecurity threats.
**Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and documentation to help you understand each detection's purpose, scope, and implementation.
**Community Contributions**: Contributions from the cybersecurity community that enrich our repository with diverse perspectives and expertise.

## Getting Started
To get started with Armory, we recommend the following steps:

**Explore the Detections**: Browse through the detections available in this repository to understand their scope and application. Each piece of detection logic is stored in YAML format along with certain enrichment components such as MITRE ATT&CK mappings.
**Implementation**: Detection logic contains macros as placeholders to call respective data sets such as endpoint, web, etc. These macros will need to be replaced with the appropriate logic to function. Once replaced, feel free to copy, paste, and run!
**Contribute**: If you're interested in contributing to Armory, please see the contribution guidelines below or feel free to contact us via the support email.

## Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions from the cybersecurity community! If you have a detection rule or an enhancement suggestion, please follow these steps:
