title: SQL Server xp_cmdshell Enabled
description: The xp_cmdshell Extended Stored Procedure in Microsoft SQL Server can
  execute commands on the system with the same security context as SQL Server, allowing
  attackers to escalate privileges and establish persistence as seen in attacks involving
  BlueSky ransomware. This use case detects event 15457 (server configuration changes)
  for MSSQLSERVER where xp_cmdshell has been enabled. While enabling xp_cmdshell does
  not indicate malicious activity on its own, unexpected enabling of the feature should
  be investigated due to its potential for abuse.
