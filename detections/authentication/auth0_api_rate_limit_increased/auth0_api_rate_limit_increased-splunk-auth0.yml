title: 'Auth0: API Rate Limit Increased'
description: Threat actors may attempt to abuse increased authentication API rate
  limits to conduct large-scale credential stuffing or brute-force attacks without
  triggering standard rate-limiting protections. This use case detects instances where
  elevated public authentication API limits are enabled, which could indicate legitimate
  scaling needs or potential abuse by an attacker seeking to bypass authentication
  throttling.
