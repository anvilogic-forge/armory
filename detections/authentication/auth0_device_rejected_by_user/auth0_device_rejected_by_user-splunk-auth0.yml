title: 'Auth0: Device Rejected by User'
description: Threat actors may attempt to enroll a new MFA device but fail to complete
  the confirmation step, either due to security controls or lack of access to the
  legitimate userâ€™s approval method. This use case detects instances where a user
  did not confirm a device enrollment, which could indicate an attacker trying to
  register an unauthorized MFA device.
