title: 'Auth0: Email Notification Failure'
description: Threat actors may disrupt security notifications, password resets, or
  user communications by causing email delivery failures, either through misconfiguration
  or targeted attacks. This use case detects failed attempts to send email notifications,
  which could indicate email service issues, unauthorized changes to email settings,
  or attempts to suppress security alerts.
