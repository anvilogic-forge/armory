title: 'Auth0: Email Verification Failed'
description: Threat actors may attempt to bypass email-based multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) or account verification but fail due to incorrect codes, expired links, or
  security controls. This use case detects failed email verification attempts, which
  could indicate user error, an attacker testing stolen credentials, or an attempt
  to manipulate account recovery processes.
