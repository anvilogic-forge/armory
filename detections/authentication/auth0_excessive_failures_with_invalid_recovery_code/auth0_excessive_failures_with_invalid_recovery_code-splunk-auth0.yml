title: 'Auth0: Excessive failures with invalid recovery code'
description: Monitoring excessive failed recovery code attempts may indicate a brute-force
  attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) or unauthorized access attempts.
  Repeated failures suggest an attacker is trying to guess or manipulate the recovery
  process, potentially compromising an account. This rule will monitor events for
  excessive failed recovery code attempts (gd_recovery_rate_limit_exceed), which could
  signal an attempted MFA bypass or unauthorized account access.
