title: 'Auth0: Excessive Login Failures for Single Account'
description: Threat actors may target a specific account with repeated failed login
  attempts in an effort to brute-force the password or test stolen credentials. This
  use case detects IP addresses that have been blocked after exceeding the maximum
  failed login attempts for a single account, which could indicate a focused account
  takeover attempt.

logic: '`get_authentication_data_auth0` "limit_wc" OR "An IP address is blocked because
  it reached the maximum failed login attempts into a single account" | where event_type="limit_wc"
