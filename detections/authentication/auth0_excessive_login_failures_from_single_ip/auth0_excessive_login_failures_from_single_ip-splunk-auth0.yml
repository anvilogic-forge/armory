title: 'Auth0: Excessive Login Failures from Single IP'
description: Threat actors may attempt rapid, repeated login attempts to brute-force
  credentials or exploit session-based authentication limits. This use case detects
  users temporarily blocked from logging in due to excessive attempts from the same
  IP, which could indicate an automated attack or compromised account testing.
