title: 'Auth0: Excessive Login Failures or Signups'
description: Threat actors may attempt credential stuffing or brute-force attacks
  by repeatedly trying login or signup attempts with different credentials. This use
  case detects IP addresses that have been blocked due to excessive failed logins
  or sign-ups, which could indicate an automated attack or account takeover attempt.
logic_format: Splunk
logic: '`get_authentication_data_auth0` "limit_mu" OR "An IP address is blocked because
  it attempted too many failed logins without a successful login" OR "Or an IP address
  is blocked because it attempted too many sign-ups, whether successful or failed."
  | where event_type="limit_mu" | table _time, host, user, signature, City, Region,
  Country, src_ip, coi_user | bin span=1s | stats values(*) as * by _time, src_ip '
