title: 'Auth0: Failed Access Token Exchange'
description: Threat actors may attempt to bypass authentication by exploiting weaknesses
  in token exchange flows, abusing misconfigurations, or using stolen credentials.
  This use case detects failed attempts to exchange various authentication tokens
  for access tokens, which could indicate unauthorized access attempts, brute-force
  attacks, or misconfigured authentication integrations.
