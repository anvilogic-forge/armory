title: 'Auth0: Failed CIBA Token Exchange Attempt'
description: Threat actors may attempt to exploit the Client-Initiated Backchannel
  Authentication (CIBA) flow by using stolen or manipulated authentication request
  IDs to gain unauthorized access. This use case detects failed attempts to exchange
  an AuthReqId for an access token, which could indicate misuse of the CIBA protocol,
  expired or invalid authentication requests, or an attacker attempting to bypass
  authentication.
