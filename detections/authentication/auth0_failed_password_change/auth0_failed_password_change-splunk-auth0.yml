title: 'Auth0: Failed password change'
description: Monitoring events for failed password changes and requests to change
  passwords could indicate account takeover attempts or brute-force activity targeting
  password reset functionality. Detecting these events can help identify unauthorized
  attempts to compromise user accounts. This rule will monitor events for failed password
  change attempts, "fcp", "Failed Change Password", "fcpr", "Failed Change Password
  Request" which can indicate credential abuse or potential account takeover.
