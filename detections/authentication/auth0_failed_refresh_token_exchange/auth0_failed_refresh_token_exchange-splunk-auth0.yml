title: 'Auth0: Failed Refresh Token Exchange'
description: Threat actors may attempt to reuse or exchange stolen refresh tokens
  to maintain persistent access without re-authenticating. This use case detects failed
  attempts to exchange refresh tokens, which could indicate token theft, session hijacking,
  or an attacker attempting to bypass authentication controls.
