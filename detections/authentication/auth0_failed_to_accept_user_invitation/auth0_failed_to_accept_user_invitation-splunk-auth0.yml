title: 'Auth0: Failed to Accept User Invitation'
description: Threat actors may attempt to gain access to an organization by accepting
  user invitations with unauthorized or mismatched email addresses. This use case
  detects failed user invitation acceptances, which could indicate a legitimate user
  error, provisioning issues, or an attacker attempting to exploit the invitation
  process for unauthorized access.
