title: 'Auth0: Failed username change'
description: Threat actors may attempt MFA fatigue attacks by bombarding a user with
  push-notification requests, hoping they will approve access out of frustration or
  confusion. This use case tracks the volume of MFA push requests, successful authentications,
  and rejected attempts per user, which could indicate an attacker spamming MFA notifications
  to gain unauthorized access.
