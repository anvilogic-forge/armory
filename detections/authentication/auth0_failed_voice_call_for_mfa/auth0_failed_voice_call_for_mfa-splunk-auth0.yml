title: 'Auth0: Failed Voice Call for MFA'
description: Threat actors may attempt to exploit voice-based multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) but fail due to incorrect configurations, service disruptions, or security
  controls. This use case detects failed MFA voice call attempts, which could indicate
  user error, telephony service issues, or an attacker probing MFA mechanisms for
  weaknesses.
