title: 'Auth0: Guardian tenant update'
description: Monitoring updates to Auth0 Guardian possibly altering the MFA process,
  which could be exploited to weaken or bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) security.
  Unauthorized modifications may suggest an attempt to disable or alter MFA enforcement,
  potentially allowing unauthorized access. This rule will monitor events for changes
  to Guardian MFA settings, looking for ""gd_tenant_update" events to help detect
  potential manipulation of authentication processes.
