title: 'Auth0: Login warning events'
description: Monitoring warning logs during login can help detect potential authentication
  issues, misconfigurations, or suspicious activity that may indicate attempted unauthorized
  access. These warnings may include unusual login behavior, or potential security
  risks that require further investigation. This rule will monitor events for login-related
  warnings (w), which could signal authentication anomalies, or configuration issues.
