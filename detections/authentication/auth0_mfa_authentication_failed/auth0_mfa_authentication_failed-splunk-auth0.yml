title: 'Auth0: MFA Authentication Failed'
description: This use case detects failed MFA attempts which could indicate an attacker
  trying to access an account but failing the MFA challenge. Threat actors may use
  this technique during a brute-force attack, credential stuffing, or after stealing
  a password but lacking the second factor needed to complete authentication.
