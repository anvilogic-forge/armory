title: 'Auth0: MFA Device Unenrolled'
description: Threat actors may remove existing MFA devices to disable multi-factor
  authentication and weaken account security, allowing for easier future access. This
  use case detects the unenrollment of an MFA device, which could indicate an attacker
  attempting to bypass MFA protections after compromising an account.
