title: 'Auth0: MFA Enrollment Failed'
description: Threat actors may attempt to enroll a new MFA device on a compromised
  account but fail due to security controls, user intervention, or misconfiguration.
  This use case detects failed MFA enrollment attempts, which could indicate an attacker
  trying to register an unauthorized authentication method or issues with legitimate
  user enrollment.
