title: 'Auth0: MFA Notification Failure'
description: Threat actors may attempt to trigger MFA notifications but fail due to
  security policies, service disruptions, or rate limits, potentially as part of an
  attack to manipulate authentication flows. This use case detects failed attempts
  to send MFA push or SMS notifications, which could indicate an attacker probing
  MFA mechanisms or a disruption in authentication services.
