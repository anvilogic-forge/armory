title: 'Auth0: Multiple Failed Logins for Single Account'
description: Threat actors may attempt authentication-related actions that fail due
  to security controls, policy restrictions, or incorrect credentials. This use case
  detects 5 or more authentication failures for a single user in a 5 minute time period,
  which could indicate an attacker testing credentials, abusing authentication workflows,
  or probing for misconfigurations.
