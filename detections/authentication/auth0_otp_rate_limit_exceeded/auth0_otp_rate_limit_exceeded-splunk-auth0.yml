title: 'Auth0: OTP Rate Limit Exceeded'
description: Threat actors may attempt MFA fatigue attacks or brute-force OTP codes
  by repeatedly requesting one-time passcodes, hoping to guess or manipulate authentication
  flows. This use case detects excessive OTP requests within a short period, which
  could indicate an attacker spamming OTP prompts to bypass multi-factor authentication.
