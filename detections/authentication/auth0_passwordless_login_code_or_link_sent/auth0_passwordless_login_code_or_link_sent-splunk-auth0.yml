title: 'Auth0: Passwordless Login Code or Link Sent'
description: Threat actors may attempt to abuse passwordless authentication by requesting
  excessive login codes or links to gain unauthorized access or perform phishing attacks.
  This use case detects instances where a passwordless login code or link has been
  sent, which could indicate legitimate user authentication or potential abuse, such
  as an attacker attempting to brute-force or socially engineer access.
