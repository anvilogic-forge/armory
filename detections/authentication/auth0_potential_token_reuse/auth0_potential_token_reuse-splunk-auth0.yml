title: 'Auth0: Potential Token Reuse'
description: Threat actors may attempt to gain unauthorized access by exchanging various
  authentication factors—such as passwords, passkeys, OTPs, recovery codes, or refresh
  tokens—for access tokens. This use case detects successful access token uses from
  multiple IP addresses within an hour which could indcate an attacker leveraging
  stolen session tokens to maintain persistent access.
