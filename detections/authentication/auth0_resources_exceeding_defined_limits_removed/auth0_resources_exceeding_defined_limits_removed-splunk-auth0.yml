title: 'Auth0: Resources Exceeding Defined Limits Removed'
description: Threat actors may attempt to overwhelm system resources or manipulate
  retention policies to disrupt services or conceal malicious activity. This use case
  detects the automatic removal of resources exceeding defined limits, which could
  indicate normal system maintenance or an attacker intentionally triggering resource
  cleanup to erase forensic evidence.
