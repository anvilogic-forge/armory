title: 'Auth0: Signup Attempt Using Leaked Password'
description: Threat actors may attempt to create new accounts using credentials that
  have been previously exposed in data breaches, potentially to exploit reused passwords.
  This use case detects sign-up attempts with leaked passwords, which could indicate
  an attacker testing compromised credentials or an unsuspecting user reusing a breached
  password.
