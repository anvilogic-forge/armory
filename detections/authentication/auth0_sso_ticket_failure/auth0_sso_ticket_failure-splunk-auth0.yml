title: 'Auth0: SSO Ticket Failure'
description: Threat actors may attempt to exploit Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication
  flows by manipulating session tokens, misconfiguring identity providers, or abusing
  federation settings. This use case detects failed SSO ticket generation or consumption,
  which could indicate authentication misconfigurations, service disruptions, or an
  attacker attempting to gain unauthorized access.
