title: 'Auth0: Successful Access Token Exchange'
description: Threat actors may attempt to gain unauthorized access by exchanging various
  authentication factors—such as passwords, passkeys, OTPs, recovery codes, or refresh
  tokens—for access tokens. This use case detects successful access token exchanges,
  which could indicate legitimate authentication or an attacker leveraging stolen
  credentials or session tokens to maintain persistent access.
