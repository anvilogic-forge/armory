title: 'Auth0: Successful login after multiple recovery errors'
description: Monitoring successful authentication with a recovery code (gd_recovery_succeed)
  is crucial as it may indicate legitimate account recovery or a potential unauthorized
  access attempt following multiple failed recovery attempts. If an attacker has gained
  access to a recovery code, they could bypass standard multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) protections and compromise the account. This rule will monitor events for
  successful recovery code authentication (gd_recovery_succeed), which could indicate
  legitimate account access or a potential unauthorized login following failed recovery
  attempts.
