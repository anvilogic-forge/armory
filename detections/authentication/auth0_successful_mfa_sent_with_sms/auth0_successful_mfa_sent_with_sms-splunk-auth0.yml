title: 'Auth0: Successful MFA sent with SMS'
description: 'Monitoring the sending of a SMS code for mfa authentication is relevant
  as SMS-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) is generally a weaker authentication
  method. Tracking these events can help identify unusual MFA activity that may indicate
  an account takeover attempt. This rule will monitor events for successful MFA SMS
  messages: "gd_send_sms", OR "SMS for MFA successfully sent." to detect potential
  misuse or anomalous authentication attempts.'
