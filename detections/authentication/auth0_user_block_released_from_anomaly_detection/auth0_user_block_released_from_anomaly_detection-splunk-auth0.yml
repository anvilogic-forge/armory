title: 'Auth0: User block released from anomaly detection'
description: Monitoring the release of a blocked user from anomaly detection being
  lifted. This could signal a legitimate user regaining access or a potential attacker
  bypassing security controls to regain entry. This rule will monitor events for ""ublkdu",
  OR "User block setup by anomaly detection has been released" with user blocks being
  released by anomaly detection, helping to identify potential unauthorized access
  or suspicious authentication activity.
