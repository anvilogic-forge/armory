  operations may indicate potential misconfigurations, unauthorized access attempts,
  or suspicious account modifications. Identifying these anomalies can help prevent
  privilege escalation or account takeovers. This rule will monitor events with: "wum",
  OR "Filters for logs of type warning during user management operations" to help
  detect potential security risks or misconfigurations.'
