title: 'Auth0: WebAuthn Enrollment Failed'
description: Threat actors may attempt to enroll a rogue WebAuthn device on a compromised
  account but fail due to security controls, misconfiguration, or lack of proper credentials.
  This use case detects failed WebAuthn enrollment attempts, which could indicate
  an attacker attempting to register an unauthorized authentication method or legitimate
  user enrollment issues.
