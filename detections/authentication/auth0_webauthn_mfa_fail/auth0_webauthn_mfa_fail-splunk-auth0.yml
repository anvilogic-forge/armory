title: 'Auth0: WebAuthn MFA Fail'
description: Threat actors may attempt to bypass WebAuthn-based MFA but fail due to
  incorrect credentials, lack of access to the required device, or security controls
  preventing authentication. This use case detects failed WebAuthn verification attempts,
  which could indicate an attacker attempting to gain unauthorized access or a legitimate
  user experiencing authentication issues.
