title: Okta Successful MFA After Multiple Failures
description: 'Detection for a potential brute-force attack with Okta MFA. This use
  case looks for instances where a account experiences multiple MFA push authentication
  failures followed by successful logins, which could indicate potential unauthorized
  access attempts. -- Threat Actor Association: LUCR-3, Scattered Spider (aka. Muddled
  Libra, Scatter Swine, Starfraud, UNC3944)'
