title: AWS AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole Attached
description: The AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy grants permissions for AWS Lambda
  functions to write logs to Amazon CloudWatch. While this policy is commonly used
  in legitimate serverless applications, its attachment—especially in unusual contexts
  or by unauthorized users—can indicate that a threat actor is preparing to deploy
  or invoke Lambda functions for malicious purposes, such as running backdoor code
  or staging post-exploitation payloads. This use case will detect the attachment
  of the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy in AWS CloudTrail, which may indicate
  the setup or execution of Lambda functions. Monitoring this activity helps identify
  potential misuse of serverless capabilities for unauthorized code execution or persistence.
