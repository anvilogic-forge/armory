description: 'Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or
  from the compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems
  by querying for information over the network. An adversary who gains access to a
  system that is part of a cloud-based environment may map out Virtual Private Clouds
  or Virtual Networks in order to determine what systems and services are connected
