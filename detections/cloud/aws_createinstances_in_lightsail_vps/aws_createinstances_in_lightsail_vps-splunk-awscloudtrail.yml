title: AWS CreateInstances in Lightsail VPS
description: AWS Lightsail is a simplified compute service that provides an easy way
  to launch and manage virtual private servers (instances) for various purposes. Threat
  actors can abuse this service by creating instances to host malicious content, launch
  attacks, or carry out unauthorized activities. This use case detects CreateInstance
  events from the Lightsail service.
