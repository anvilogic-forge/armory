title: AWS CreateSnapshot
description: The CreateSnapshot API call is used to create a snapshot of an EBS volume.
  A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume that can be used to create a
  new EBS volume (for data recovery or scaling purposes) or for backup. The CreateSnapshot
  operation captures the state of the EBS volume at the moment the snapshot command
  is executed, including all the data it contains, and stores it in Amazon S3. Threat
  actors can abuse this technique to gain access to data stored on EC2 instances where
  they are unable to achieve direct access. This use case detects CreateSnapshot events.
