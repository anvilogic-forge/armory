title: AWS DisableAWSServiceAccess
description: The DisableAWSServiceAccess API call in AWS CloudTrail indicates when
  a service-linked role is being disabled for an AWS service. Service-linked roles
  are used by AWS services to perform actions on your behalf, and disabling them can
  prevent those services from operating properly. This use case detects attempts to
  disable service-linked roles via the DisableAWSServiceAccess API call in AWS CloudTrail.
  Such activity may indicate efforts to disrupt or evade monitoring services, particularly
  if performed outside of normal administrative operations.
