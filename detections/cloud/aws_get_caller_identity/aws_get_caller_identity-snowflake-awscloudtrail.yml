title: AWS Get Caller Identity
description: Amazon Elastic Container Services or ECS, is an offering from Amazon
  Web Services (AWS) designed to provide a platform to host containerized applications
  in the cloud. Adversaries may enumerate Task definitions as they are responsible
  for configuring the actual containers that will be running in ECS. Since task definitions
  define how containers will run, a plethora of information can be found within.
