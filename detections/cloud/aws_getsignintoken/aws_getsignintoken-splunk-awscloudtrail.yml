title: AWS GetSigninToken
description: The GetSigninToken API is part of the AWS Security Token Service and
  is used to generate a URL that allows federated users to sign in to the AWS Management
  Console via the AWS federation endpoint. Essentially, it provides a way to create
  a URL that users can click on to gain temporary access to the AWS Management Console
  without having to provide a username and password directly. Threat actors may attempt
  to abuse GetSignintoken to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources. This use case
  detects when GetSigninToken is called. Events will occur when using the AWS SSO
  portal to login. Filtering or allowlisting for expected user agents is recommended
  to reduce false positives. Non-SSO configured roles would be considered abnormal
  and should be investigated.
