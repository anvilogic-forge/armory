title: AWS Lambda CreateFunction
description: 'AWS Lambda CreateFunction is an API call that allows users to create
  a new Lambda function in their AWS environment, defining the function''s code, runtime,
  and configuration settings. Threat actors might abuse this API call to establish
  persistence or execute arbitrary code by deploying malicious functions, often leveraging
  stolen or exposed credentials, as part of a larger attack strategy within a compromised
  AWS account. This use case detects when CreateFunction is called. Note: In the CloudTrail
  log file, the eventName CreateFunction might include date and version information,
  but it is still referring to the same public API action. See AWS documentation for
  further details.'
