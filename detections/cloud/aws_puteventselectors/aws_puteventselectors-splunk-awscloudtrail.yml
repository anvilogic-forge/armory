title: AWS PutEventSelectors
description: PutEventSelectors is a function that provides a record of actions taken
  by a user, role, or an AWS service in AWS, in the form of event logs. This function
  allows users to configure CloudTrail to record detailed information about the API
  calls made to specific AWS resources or to exclude recording API calls for certain
  resources. By adjusting event selectors, threat actors can control the scope of
  events that CloudTrail logs in order to evade detection, either through excluding
  which activities are logged or configuring CloudTrail to log an excessive amount
  of low-value events. This use case detects when PutEventSelectors is called.
