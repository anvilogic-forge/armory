title: AWS SendSSHPublicKey
description: SendSSHPublicKey pushes an SSH public key to the specified EC2 instance
  for use by the specified user. While this service is designed to enhance security
  by eliminating the need for permanent SSH keys, it can also be exploited by threat
  actors if not properly secured, leading to unauthorized access, persistence, privilege
  escalation, or lateral movement. This use case detection when SendSSHPublicKey is
  called.
