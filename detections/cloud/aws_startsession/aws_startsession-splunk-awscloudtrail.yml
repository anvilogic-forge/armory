title: AWS StartSession
description: StartSession initiates a connection to a target (for example, a managed
  node) for a Session Manager session, returning a URL and token that can be used
  to open a WebSocket connection for sending input and receiving outputs. Because
  this method does not require an SSH inbound rule in the associated security group
  of the EC2 instance, security group rules are bypassed. This use case detection
  when StartSession is called.
