title: AWS UpdateAssumeRolePolicy
description: 'Threat actors may add additional roles to a compromised or attacker-created
  cloud account to achieve persistence in a cloud environment. This use case detects
  UpdateAssumeRolePolicy events which updates the policy that grants an IAM entity
  permission to assume a role. This is typically referred to as the "role trust policy". '
