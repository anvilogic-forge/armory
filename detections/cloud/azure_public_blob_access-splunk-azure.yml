title: Azure Public Blob Access
description: Anonymous public read access to containers and blobs in Azure Storage
  is a convenient way to share data, but may also present a security risk. By default,
  public access to your blob data is always prohibited. However, the default configuration
  for a storage account permits a user with appropriate permissions to configure public
  access to containers and blobs in a storage account.
