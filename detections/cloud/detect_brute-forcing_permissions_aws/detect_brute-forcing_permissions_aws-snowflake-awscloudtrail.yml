title: Detect Brute-Forcing Permissions (AWS)
description: Permissions let you specify access to AWS resources. Permissions are
  granted to IAM entities (users, groups, and roles) and by default, these entities
  start with no permissions. In other words, IAM entities can do nothing in AWS until
  you grant them your desired permissions. To give entities permissions, you can attach
  a policy that specifies the type of access, the actions that can be performed, and
  the resources on which the actions can be performed. In addition, you can specify
  any conditions that must be set for access to be allowed or denied. If an attacker
  has your ID, various attack scenarios become feasible, including resource enumeration
  (identifying existing roles, users, and permissions.) In order to find the permissions
  for a certain user, there is a brute-forcing technique which consists in making
  all the possible AWS API calls.
