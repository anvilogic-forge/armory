title: ECS Create Cluster
description: Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) a fully managed container
  orchestration service that simplifies cloud deployment, management, and scaling
  of containerized applications. AWS API action "CreateCluster" creates a new Amazon
  ECS cluster. This API event can be indicative of malicious activity if adversaries
  are abusing AWS resources to create new unauthorized resources or if it is performed
  with unusual or unauthorized access patterns, such as an unexpected source IP address
  or unusual frequency of requests.
