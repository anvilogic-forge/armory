title: 'GCP: Log Sink Modified'
description: Threat actors may modify log sinks to manipulate or disrupt log data,
  which can be a tactic to evade detection or obscure malicious activities within
  the cloud environment. This rule detects the creation, update, or deletion of logging
  sinks in Google Cloud Platform. Google Service accounts (*@gserviceaccounts.com)
  have been filtered out to reduce false positives.
