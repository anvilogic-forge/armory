title: Google Workspace Domain Wide Delegation
description: This use case detects when a domain-wide delegation of authority is granted
  to a service account. Domain-wide delegation can be configured to grant third-party
  and internal applications to access the data of Google Workspace users. An adversary
  may configure domain-wide delegation to maintain access to their targetâ€™s data.
  This activity on its own does not indicate malicious activity, but should be validated
  due to its wide-reaching access.
