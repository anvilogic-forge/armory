title: O365 Add User to app Role Assignment
description: Application Permissions, also known as AppRoles and AppRoleAssignments,
  enable an application to perform API operations that access or manipulate data without
  a signed-in user. Application Permissions allows the application to interact with
  an API as itself, without a session that is acting on behalf of a specific user.
  This use case should function for O365 and Azure AAD logging.
