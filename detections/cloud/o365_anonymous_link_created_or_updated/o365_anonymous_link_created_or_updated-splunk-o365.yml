title: O365 Anonymous Link Created or Updated
description: This use case detects when an anonymous sharing link is created or updated
  for files and folders in SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business. These links
  allow external users to access shared content without authentication, meaning anyone
  with the link can access the resource, making it a potential security risk if not
  managed carefully. A threat actor could abuse the AnonymousLinkCreated and AnonymousLinkUpdated
  functionality to gain access to sensitive data, bypass authentication mechanisms,
  and exfiltrate information.
