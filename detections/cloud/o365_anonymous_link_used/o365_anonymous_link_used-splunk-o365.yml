title: O365 Anonymous Link Used
description: This use case detects when an anonymous sharing link is used to access
  files or folders in SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business. These links allow
  external users to access shared content without authentication, meaning anyone with
  the link can access the resource, making it a potential security risk if not managed
  carefully. A threat actor could abuse the anonymous link functionality to gain access
  to sensitive data, bypass authentication mechanisms, and exfiltrate information.
