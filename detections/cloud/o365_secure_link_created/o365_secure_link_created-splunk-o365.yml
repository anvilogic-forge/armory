title: O365 Secure Link Created
description: This use case detects when a secure link is created for files and folders
  in SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business. These links allow users to access
  shared content, making it a potential security risk if not managed carefully. A
  threat actor could abuse the secure link functionality to gain access to sensitive
  data, bypass authentication mechanisms, and exfiltrate information.
