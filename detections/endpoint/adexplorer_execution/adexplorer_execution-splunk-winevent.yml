title: ADExplorer Execution
description: Active Directory Explorer (AD Explorer) is a tool from the Sysinternals
  suite that allows users to view, search, and analyze objects within Active Directory
  to understand its structure, object properties, and security settings. A threat
  actor might leverage AD Explorer to gain detailed insights into the AD environment,
  such as identifying privileged user accounts and network resources, which can be
  exploited to escalate privileges or facilitate lateral movement within a network.
  This use case detects executions of ADExplorer .
