title: ADExplorer Snapshot Creation
description: Active Directory Explorer (AD Explorer) is a tool from the Sysinternals
  suite that allows users to view, search, and analyze objects within Active Directory,
  and it includes the capability to take snapshots of the AD database for offline
  analysis. A threat actor might leverage AD Explorer to gain detailed insights into
  the AD environment and use its snapshot capability to discreetly export and study
  the structure, user accounts, and security settings, potentially identifying vectors
  for privilege escalation or lateral movement within a network. This use case detects
  executions of ADExplorer with the snapshot command.
