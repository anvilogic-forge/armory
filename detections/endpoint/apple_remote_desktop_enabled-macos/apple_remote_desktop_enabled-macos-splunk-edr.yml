title: Apple Remote Desktop Enabled - macOS
description: Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) is a remote management tool for macOS, enabling
  software distribution, remote assistance, system administration, and asset management.
  Administrators use the ARD app, available on the Mac App Store, to manage clients.
  The client component is built into macOS and can be activated via the Sharing settings
  in System Preferences or on the command line using the kickstart service. Threat
  actors have been observed enabling ARD on compromised hosts to achieve GUI access,
  persistence, and evasion. This use case detects kickstart commands with arguments
  to enable ARD.
