title: Application Discovery - Windows
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of software and software versions
  that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment. Adversaries may use the
  information from Software Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on
  behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or
  attempts specific actions. Adversaries may attempt to enumerate software for a variety
  of reasons, such as figuring out what security measures are present or if the compromised
  system has a version of software that is vulnerable to Exploitation for Privilege
  Escalation. This use case detects commands enumerating applications installed on
  a Windows system. Atomics T1518 Test #2'
