title: Attempted Veeam Database Credential Dump
description: 'Operators from the Diavol ransomware gang were observed using sqlcmd
  to extract encrypted credentials from Veeam databases that were decrypted using
  a publicly documented technique on Veeam''s R+D forums. This use case detects commands
  targeting credentials stored in Veeam databases. While sqlcmd.exe was used in documented
  cases, the logic is not reliant on detecting sqlcmd.exe to account for instances
  where the binary has been renamed or another utility was used to interact with the
  database. -- Threat Actor Association: UTA0178 -- Software Association: Akira'
