title: AutoHotkey Execution
description: Adversaries may execute commands and perform malicious tasks using AutoIT
  and AutoHotKey automation scripts. AutoIT and AutoHotkey (AHK) are scripting languages
  that enable users to automate Windows tasks. These automation scripts can be used
  to perform a wide variety of actions, such as clicking on buttons, entering text,
  and opening and closing programs. This use case detects the usage of the AutoHotkey
  software to execute ahk files.
