title: AWS Instance Metadata Service Queried for Credentials - *nix
description: The AWS Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) provides detailed information
  about EC2 instances, including identity documents, network details, security credentials,
  and user data. It also offers dynamic data about the instance's AMI, reservation
  information, and configuration scripts passed on instance launch. Threat actors
  have been observed querying the AWS IMDS for security credentials or account IDs
  in attacks, such as the Capital One breach in 2019 or attack attempts by threat
  actor group Kinsing. This use case detects queries to 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials
  or http://169.254.169.254/latest/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document with
  a status code in the 200s (indicates successful connection). Legitimate services
  within your infrastructure may access the IMDS; validating and allowlisting is recommended.
