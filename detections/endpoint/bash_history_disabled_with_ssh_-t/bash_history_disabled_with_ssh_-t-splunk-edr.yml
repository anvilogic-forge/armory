title: Bash History Disabled with SSH -T
description: 'In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command
  history or disable command logging of a compromised account to conceal the actions
  undertaken during an intrusion. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands
  users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they''ve done. This
  use case detects ssh used with the switch -T which disables pseudo-tty allocation.
