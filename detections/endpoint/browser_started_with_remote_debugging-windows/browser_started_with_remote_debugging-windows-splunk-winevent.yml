title: Browser Started with Remote Debugging - Windows
description: Threat actors may abuse browser remote debugging features to extract
  sensitive data, maintain access, or facilitate communication with C2 servers. This
  is typically done by launching the browser with specific remote debugging flags,
  allowing remote access to browser sessions and potentially bypassing traditional
  security controls. This use case detects instances where a browser is started in
  remote debugging mode.
