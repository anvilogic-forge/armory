title: Bypass or Unrestricted PowerShell Execution
description: 'This use case identifies instances where PowerShell is executed with
  specific, potentially insecure execution policies such as Unrestricted, Bypass,
  or RemoteSigned. Threat actors may exploit these settings to execute malicious scripts
  or commands, as they allow scripts to run without the usual restrictions and without
  requiring digital signatures. -- Threat Actor Association: UNC4990 - Software Association:
  Rhysida'
