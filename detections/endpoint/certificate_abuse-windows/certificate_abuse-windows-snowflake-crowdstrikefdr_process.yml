title: Certificate Abuse - Windows
description: Threat actors may use tools such as Certipy or Certify.exe to enumerate
  misconfigurations in certificate services, allowing them to gather information on
  potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation or lateral
  movement within a network. This use case identifies potential abuse of Active Directory
  Certificate Services by monitoring Certificate Services events (4886 and 4887) or
  process creation events (event ID 4688) involving tools commonly used to exploit
  vulnerable configurations in AD CS such as certify.exe, accounting for instances
  where the binary has been renamed.
