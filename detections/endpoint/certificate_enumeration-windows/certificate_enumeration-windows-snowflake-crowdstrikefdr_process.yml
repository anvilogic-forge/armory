title: Certificate Enumeration - Windows
description: Threat actors may use tools such as Certipy or Certify.exe to enumerate
  misconfigurations in certificate services, allowing them to gather information on
  potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation or lateral
  movement within a network. This use case identifies potential abuse of Active Directory
  Certificate Services by monitoring file access events (event ID 5145) related to
  certificate or certification authority data or process creation events (event ID
  4688) involving tools commonly used to enumerate or exploit vulnerable configurations
  in AD CS (e.g., Certipy or Certify).

  ''i'') or process_path ilike ''%certify.exe'') and not process_path ilike ''%find.exe'' '
