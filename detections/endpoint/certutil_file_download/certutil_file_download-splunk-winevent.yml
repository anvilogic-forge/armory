title: Certutil File Download
description: 'There are attack scenarios in which attackers download different tools
  or scripts in order to take full control over certain machines. For example, an
  attacker gets a reverse shell on the target but is a low privileged shell. In this
  situation, the attacker can download different exploits on the target for privilege
  escalation using tools such as wget. -- Threat Actor Association: APT41, DarkSide,
  BlackMatter, APT31, Flax Typhoon, Wizard Spider - Software Association: ALPHV/BlackCat,
  Babuk, Bazar, Conti -- Atomics T1027 Test #8'
