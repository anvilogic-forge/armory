title: Cipher.exe Execution
description: Cipher.exe is a Windows command-line utility used for managing encryption
  on NTFS drives and securely overwriting data to prevent recovery. Threat actors
  may destroy data on specific systems or across a network to disrupt the availability
  of systems, services, or resources. This often involves overwriting files or data
  on local and remote drives, rendering the information irrecoverable. Unlike basic
  file deletion commands (e.g., del or rm), which typically remove file pointers but
  leave data recoverable through forensic techniques, this method ensures complete
  data loss by overwriting the content. Threat actors may overwrite files and directories
  with random data or other content to prevent recovery and obscure their activity.
  This tactic targets individual files rather than wiping entire disk sections or
  logical structures. This use case detects the execution of cipher.exe with the /w
  flag, accounting for instances where the binary has been renamed. Executions of
  processes using arguments with the pattern " /w:" followed by non-numeric characters
  should be allowlisted to reduce false positives.
