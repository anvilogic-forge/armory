title: Code Injection by ld.so.preload
description: Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment
  variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution
  preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths
  of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on
  Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS. Libraries specified in environment variables
  are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function
  name. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing
  to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without
  changing the original library. On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point
  to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested
  by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious
  code upon execution of the victim program. LD_PRELOAD can be set via the environment
  variable or /etc/ld.so.preload file. Libraries specified by LD_PRELOAD are loaded
  and mapped into memory by dlopen() and mmap() respectively. This use case detects
  when ld.so.preload file was created/modified, indicating an attempt to execute malicious
  payloads through hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load
  shared libraries.
