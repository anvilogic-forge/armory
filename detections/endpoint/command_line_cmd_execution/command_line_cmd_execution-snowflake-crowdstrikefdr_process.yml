title: Command Line .cmd Execution
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to
  make them appear legitimate or benign to users and/or security tools. Masquerading
  occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated
  or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating
  file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate
  task or service names. This use case detects the use of cmd.exe /c to execute .cmd
  files. This technique has been used by BazaLoader to execute malware masquerading
  as a PDF inside a .zip file. -- Threat Actor Association: Andariel, APT28, APT40,
