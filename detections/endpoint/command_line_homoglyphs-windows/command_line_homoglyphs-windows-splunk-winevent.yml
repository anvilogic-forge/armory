title: Command Line Homoglyphs - Windows
description: Threat actors may use homoglyph attacks by substituting characters in
  process names or commands with visually similar Unicode symbols to impersonate legitimate
  commands, or messages (e.g., using Cyrillic “а” instead of Latin “a”). This tactic
  is often used to evade string-based detection and confuse analysts during investigation.
  This use case detects Windows processes containing Unicode characters from commonly
  abused homoglyph ranges, including Cyrillic extended, Greek extended, and full-width
  Latin letters and digits.
