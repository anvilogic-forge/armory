title: Command Line Utility Added to Accessibility Features
description: 'Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing
  malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows contains accessibility
  features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in
  (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the
  way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging
  in to the system. This use case detects registry modification commands or events
  adding cmd.exe or PowerShell/pwsh.exe to Accessibility Features registry keys.'
