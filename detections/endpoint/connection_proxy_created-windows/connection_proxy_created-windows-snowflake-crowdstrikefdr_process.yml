title: Connection Proxy Created - Windows
description: 'Adversaries use internal proxies to manage command and control communications
  inside a compromised environment, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound
  network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to
  ride over existing trusted communications paths between infected systems to avoid
  suspicion. By using a compromised internal system as a proxy, adversaries may conceal
  the true destination of C2 traffic while reducing the need for numerous connections
  to external system. This use case detects command line creation of a proxy connection
  on a Windows endpoint. -- Threat Actor Association: Volt Typhoon -- Atomics T1090.001
