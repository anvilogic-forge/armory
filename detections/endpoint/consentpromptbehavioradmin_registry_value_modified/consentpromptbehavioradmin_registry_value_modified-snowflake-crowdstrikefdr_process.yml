title: ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin Registry Value Modified
description: 'Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges
  on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges
  (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level
  permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the
  user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user
  to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through
  the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.
  This use case detects registry modification events or process executions with registry
  modification commands targeting \Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin.
