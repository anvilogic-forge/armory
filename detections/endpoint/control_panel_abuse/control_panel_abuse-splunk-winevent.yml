title: Control Panel Abuse
description: 'Adversaries may abuse control.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
  The Windows Control Panel process binary (control.exe) handles execution of Control
  Panel items, which are utilities that allow users to view and adjust computer settings.
  Adversaries may also rename malicious DLL files (.dll) with Control Panel file extensions
  (.cpl), Control Panel items, specifically CPL files, may also bypass application
  and/or file extension allow lists. - Threat Actor Association: Alloy Taurus/Gallium,
  Lazarus, UNC2589 - Atomics T1218.002 Test#1 - #TrendingThreat #Russia #Ukraine'
