title: Disabled Pre-Authentication Accounts Discovery - PowerShell
description: With the appropriate parameters, PowerShell cmdlets such as Get-ADUser
  or PowerView cmdlets including Get-DomainUser allow threat actors to discover domain
  accounts with Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled, enabling them to target accounts
  vulnerable to Kerberos attacks such as AS-REP roasting. This use case detects PowerShell
  commands with parameters targeting accounts with Pre-Authentication disabled. PowerShell
  script block logging is recommended for best detection results. Detection using
  other log sources requires the PowerShell command to be run in a manner that creates
  a new process, such as powershell -command.
