description: 'CHCP ("Change Code Page" ) is a legitimate Windows command-line utility
  used to display or set the active console''s code page. When run without parameters,
  chcp displays the number of the active console code page, providing information
  about the environment''s locale and language. Threat actors have used been observed
  using chcp during discovery activities during intrusions involving IcedID and Conti
  ransomware. This use case detects chcp executions with no command line parameters
  and a parent process of cmd or PowerShell executed by a non-system account. -- Threat
  Actor Association: APT28 (aka. Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, Strontium, Tsar Team)
  -- Living Off the Land Binary and Scripts (LOLBAS) (LOLBIN)'
