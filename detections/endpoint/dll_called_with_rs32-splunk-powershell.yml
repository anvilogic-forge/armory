title: DLL Called with RS32
description: Threat actors including Qbot have been observed using rundll32.exe to
  invoke the RS32 function during post-compromise activity. This use case detects
  DLL files invoking RS32 , accounting for instances where rundll32.exe has been renamed.
  While these exexcutions may be legitimate, unexpected executions should be investigated.
