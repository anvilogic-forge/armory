title: DLL Concatenation
description: 'Threat actors were observed using Impacket to concatenate the malicious
  proxy tool Stowaway (msoe.dll) with all DLLs starting with ''d'' from the system32
  directory into a single DLL (appmgmt.dll) to pad and obfuscate the malicious DLL,
  thereby facilitating its deployment and evasion. This use case detects copy commands
  followed by either *.dll or multiple .dll references, indicating possible attempts
  to concatenate multiple DLLs into a single file. NOTE: For commands using ''copy''
  or ''type'', they must be executed in a way that creates a new process, e.g. with
  cmd /c or powershell -c, as they are built-in commands that run within the current
  cmd session and do not create new processes on their own.'
