title: DLLRegisterServer Called from Command Line
description: Threat actors including SocGhoulish may use explicit calls to DLLRegisterServer
  in the command line as a technique to register malicious DLLs, often bypassing standard
  registration methods like regsvr32. This use case detects instances where any process,
  including those masquerading as legitimate system utilities, explicitly invokes
  DLLRegisterServer in the command line. While such executions could be part of legitimate
  software installations or development activities, unexpected executions should be
  investigated.
