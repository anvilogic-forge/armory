title: Driver Loaded from Unusual Path - Windows
description: 'Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate
  privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes
  advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating
  system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Adversaries
  may also use services to install and execute malicious drivers. For example, after
  dropping a driver file (ex: .sys) to disk, the payload can be loaded and registered
  via Native API functions. This use case detects Driver loaded events excluding expected
  paths Windows\System32\drivers, Windows\SysWOW64\drivers, Windows\INF, and Windows\System32\DriverStore.'
