title: EnableLUA Registry Value Modified
description: Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on
  system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges
  (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level
  permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. This use case detects
  registry modification events or process executions with registry modification commands
  targeting HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA.
