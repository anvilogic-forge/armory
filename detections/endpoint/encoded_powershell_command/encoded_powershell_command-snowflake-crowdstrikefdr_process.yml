title: Encoded Powershell Command
description: 'PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting
  environment included in the Windows operating system. Adversaries can use PowerShell
  to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution
  of code. Encoded commands could be a way for an attacker to obfuscate malicious
  scripts they are executing on the victim machine. -- Threat Actor Association: Actinium/Gamaredon/Primitive
