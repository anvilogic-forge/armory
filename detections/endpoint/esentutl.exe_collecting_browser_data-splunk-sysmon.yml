title: Esentutl.exe Collecting Browser Data
description: 'Esentutl.exe is a Windows command line utility that provides database
  utilities for the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE). While esentutl.exe is a legitimate
  and useful tool within Windows environments, its abuse has been observed in malware
  infections including Qakbot, where it has been used to collect data from Internet
  Explorer and Microsoft Edge. This use case detects command line arguments used with
  esentutl.exe to collect data from web browsers. -- Software Association: Akira --
