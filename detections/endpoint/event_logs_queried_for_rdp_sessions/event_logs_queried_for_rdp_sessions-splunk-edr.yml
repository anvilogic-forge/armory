title: Event Logs Queried for RDP Sessions
description: 'Threat actors may query Windows Terminal Services logs for RDP session
  information. - Example 1: During post-compromise reconnaissance activities, Lazarus
  was observed using wevtutil to query Windows Terminal Services logs for RDP sessions
  (Event Code 25) in order to gather session reconnection information. - Example 2:
  Threat actor tracked as Cluster Charlie (STAC1305) searched Windows Event Logs for
  Windows Remote Connection Manager event ID 1149 -- This use case detects commands
  querying Terminal Services logs for event 25 for user disconnection or event 1149
  for records of successful Remote Desktop Services (RDP) logon attempt. While threat
  actors will most likely be using wevtutil to perform the queries, it has been omitted
  from the logic to account for instances where it has been renamed. -- Threat Actor
  Association: Cluster Charlie (STAC1305), Lazarus'
