title: Excessive DRSGetNCChanges Requests
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to access credentials and other sensitive information
  by abusing a Windows Domain Controller''s application programming interface (API)
  to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller using a technique
  called DCSync. During a FIN8 attack, a desktop device performed more than 100 DRSGetNCChanges
  requests to a domain controller. Such activity, when not performed by new domain
  controllers to sync Active Directory contents, can indicate malicious domain or
  user enumeration, credential compromise or Active Directory enumeration. This use
  case detects excessive DRSGetNChanges requests (represented by GUID 1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2).
  Note: Windows Event ID 4662 must be logged and configured correctly for detection.
  Blocklisting event 4662 event collection and forwarding from expected hosts (likely
  other Domain Controllers) is recommended for best performance, as activity from
  DCs is expected behavior. See references for details. -- Threat Actor Association:
  FIN8 (Syssphinx), Muddled Libra, Scattered Spider'
