title: Executable Running as NT AUTHORITY_SYSTEM Registered in BAM
description: Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate
  privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes
  advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating
  system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security
  constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and
  use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege
  escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.
  Background Activity Moderator is a Windows service that controls activity of background
  applications. The service was first introduced on Windows 10, specifically, after
  the Fall Creators Update (version 1709). BAM provides the full path of the executable
  files that was run on the system as well as the last execution date and time of
  these files. BAM provides evidence of program execution by listing executables under
  the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\State\UserSettings\<SID>"
  registry key. Each user specific executable is stored under the corresponding SID
  entry. BAM entries are only populated for locally run executables. Launching executables
  on network shares or removable media will not generate BAM entries. Similarly, console
  applications aren't stored on the BAM entry. In addition, BAM entries are removed
  if an executable is removed from its original location; and entries older than 7
  days are removed when Windows boots. This use case detects when an executable running
  as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM was registered in BAM registry key. This behavior was observed
  in CVE-2024-30088, but it is not specific only to this issue, rather used only as
  a reference.
