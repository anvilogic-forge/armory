title: Exfiltration via curl.exe - Windows
description: Threat actors may abuse curl.exe on Windows systems to exfiltrate data
  or upload files to remote servers using command-line options like -d, -T, --form,
  or --upload-file. These flags are commonly used for HTTP POST requests, enabling
  attackers to transmit files or sensitive information during post-compromise activity.
  This use case detects process creation events where curl.exe is used with data or
  file upload arguments, potentially indicating data exfiltration, C2 communication,
  or malicious use of legitimate tools.
