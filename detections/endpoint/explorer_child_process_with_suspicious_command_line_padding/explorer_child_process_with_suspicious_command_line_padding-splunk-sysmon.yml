title: Explorer Child Process with Suspicious Command Line Padding
description: 'Threat actors may abuse command-line padding with whitespace or non-printable
  control characters to hide malicious commands beyond the UI-visible limit, often
  using LNK files to launch payloads via explorer.exe. This technique enables stealthy
  execution by concealing the true command from the user''s view. This use case detects
  processes launched by explorer.exe where the command line contains excessive whitespace
  padding, suggesting hidden execution activity consistent with LNK-based attacks.
  Note: Due to command line logging normalization/sanitization in other log sources,
  Sysmon or EDR logging is recommended for detection. This logic was verified with
  CrowdStrike FDR logs; if your organization uses a different EDR vendor, it is strongly
  recommended to perform the test found in the Threat Examples to validate that your
  logging source is not removing the whitespace padding.'
