title: File Copied to _var_log - *nix
description: Threat actors may attempt to conceal their activities or manipulate system
  logs by copying files into the /var/log/ directory within a compromised environment.
  This technique may be employed to evade detection, establish persistence or obfuscate
  the threat actor's actions by blending in with legitimate log files. Once placed
  in the /var/log/ directory, adversaries may manipulate or delete these files to
  cover their tracks and impede forensic analysis. This use case detects files moved
  to /var/log either through terminal commands or by a program specifically designed
  to perform this action.
