description: 'Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion
  activity. Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system
  by an adversary may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and
  how. Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion
  process to minimize the adversary''s footprint. This use case detects commands removing
  files from /tmp. -- Threat Actor Association: UNC5221, UTA0178'
