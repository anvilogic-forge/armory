title: File Executed from INetCache
description: Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system
  into a compromised environment. Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled
  system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through
  alternate protocols such as ftp. Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread
  tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. Lateral Tool
  Transfer). This use case detects when a file was executed from the C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\IE
  folder.
