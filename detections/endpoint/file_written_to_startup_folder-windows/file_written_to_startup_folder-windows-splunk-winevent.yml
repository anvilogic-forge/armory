title: File Written to Startup Folder - Windows
description: Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup
  folder. Adding an entry to the startup folder will cause the program referenced
  to be executed when a user logs in. These programs will be executed under the context
  of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level. This use case
  detects file writes to \Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp.
