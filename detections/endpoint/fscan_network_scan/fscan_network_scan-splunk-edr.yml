title: FScan.exe Network Scan
description: Threat actors may use fscan, an open-source security scanning tool, to
  perform network reconnaissance, identify open ports, and detect vulnerabilities
  within a target environment. When executed, fscan often leverages rapid ICMP pings
  to scan private IP ranges for live hosts. This use case detects internal network
  scans by identifying hosts that generate over 100 rapid ICMP ping requests to private
  IP addresses matching fscan's automated command style within a grouped event window
  (default 30s), which may indicate unauthorized network scanning activity from fscan
  or similar utilities.
