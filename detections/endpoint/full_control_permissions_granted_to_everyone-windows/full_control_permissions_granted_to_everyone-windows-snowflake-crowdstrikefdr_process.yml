title: Full Control Permissions Granted to Everyone - Windows
description: 'Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade
  access control lists and access protected files. Windows implements file and directory
  ACLs as Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs). Adversaries can interact with
  the DACLs using built-in Windows commands which can grant adversaries higher permissions
  on specific files and folders. This use case detects commands assigning full control
  to Everyone which has been observed with Ryuk ransomware. -- Threat Actor Association:
