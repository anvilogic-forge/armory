title: Get-Service - PowerShell
description: 'Adversaries may try to gather information about registered local system
  services using tools as well as OS utility commands such as the PowerShell Get-Service
  cmdlet. This use case detects the PowerShell Get-Service cmdlet or its alias gsv.
  Note: PowerShell logging is recommended for best detection. Detection using other
  log sources is dependent on commands being run in manner that creates a new process,
  such as powershell -command.'
