title: Git Hooks Spawn System32 Process
description: 'Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands,
  scripts, or binaries with the help of Git hooks. These interfaces and languages
  provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across
  many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface
  and scripting capabilities, for example, Windows installations include the Windows
  Command Shell and PowerShell. This use case detects Git hooks spawning a System32
  process. Note: for best rule fidelity, Windows Event or Sysmon process creation
  logs are recommended due to their detailed parent process path information. Vulnerability
  reference: CVE-2024-32002'
