title: Git Submodule Cloned - Windows
description: 'Adversaries may abuse a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing
  files not into the submodule''s worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows
  writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running,
  giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. This
  use case detects when a submodule from a GitHub repository was cloned onto the system
