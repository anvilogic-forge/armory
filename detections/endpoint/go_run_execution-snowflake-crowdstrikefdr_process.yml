title: Go Run Execution
description: Malicious actors are beginning to turn to Golang as a malware language
  since it is not typically picked up by antivirus software. Although the language
  is about 10 years old, and is used by many legitimate programmers, there has not
  been as much activity with Golang malware. This use case looks for run executions
  by go.
