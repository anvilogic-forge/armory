title: Group Policy Editor Execution
description: Adversaries may abuse mmc.exe to proxy execution of malicious .msc files.
  Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a binary that may be signed by Microsoft and
  is used in several ways in either its GUI or in a command prompt. MMC can be used
  to create, open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created
  by Microsoft, called snap-ins. These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems
  locally or remotely. MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files to
  manage system configuration. For example, mmc gpedit.msc, will open the Group Policy
  Editor application window. This use case detects gpedit.msc executions.
