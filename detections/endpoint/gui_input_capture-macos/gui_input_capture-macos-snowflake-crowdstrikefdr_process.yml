title: GUI Input Capture - MacOS
description: 'Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt
  users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt. When programs are executed
  that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it
  is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to
  authorize the elevated privileges for the task. Adversaries may mimic this functionality
  to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number
  of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional
  access or a fake malware removal suite. Atomics T1056.002 Test #1'
