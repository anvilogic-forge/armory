title: Hidden Scheduled Task Created - Windows
description: A hidden scheduled task in Windows is a task configured to run specified
  actions silently without displaying any visible program windows or interfaces to
  the user. Threat actors may abuse this feature to persistently execute malicious
  activities covertly, avoiding detection while maintaining a presence on the victim's
  system, as observed in breaches involving Industroyer2. This use case detects scheduled
  task creation events where the 'Hidden' setting is enabled.
