title: High-Frequency nft Executions by Unprivileged User
description: Threat actors may exploit CVE-2024-1086, a Linux kernel privilege escalation
  vulnerability involving the nftables utility (nft), by executing it repeatedly as
  an unprivileged user. High-frequency nft executions in a short time window may indicate
  exploitation attempts aimed at gaining root access. Unprivileged user activity with
  nftables is unusual for most production systems. This use case detects more than
  five executions of nft within 10 seconds by a non-root user, which could signal
  malicious activity or abuse of the nft utility for privilege escalation.
