title: High Entropy Powershell
description: 'There are many tools that assist in obfuscating powershell executions
  such as Base64 encoding. Other methods include using tools like Chimera, which is
  a PowerShell obfuscation script designed to bypass AMSI and antivirus solutions.
  It digests malicious PS1''s known to trigger AV and uses string substitution and
  variable concatenation to evade common detection signatures. This use case uses
  Splunks URL Toolbox to find high entropy powershell commands. -- Software Association:
