title: Impacket atexec.py Temp File Creation
description: Impacket's atexec.py is a tool designed for executing commands on a target
  system via the Windows Task Scheduler to run arbitrary commands with the privileges
  of the account under which the scheduler is running, often providing a method for
  remote command execution which can be used by attackers during post-exploitation
  activities. This use case detects the file creation events matching characteristics
  of those created by Impacket atexec.py.
