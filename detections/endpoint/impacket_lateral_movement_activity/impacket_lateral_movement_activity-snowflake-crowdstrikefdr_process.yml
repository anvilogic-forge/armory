title: Impacket Lateral Movement Activity
description: Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols,
  primarily focused on providing tools and scripts that facilitate the interaction
  with network services and protocols commonly used in network penetration testing
  and red teaming. wmiexec, smbexec, and dcomexec are specific tools within the Impacket
  suite that use various protocols to execute commands on remote systems. This use
  case detects specific behavior patterns associated with Impacket tools wmiexec,
  smbexec, and dcomexec.
