title: Invoke-DCOM.ps1 - PowerShell
description: 'Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to interact with remote machines
  by taking advantage of Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). The adversary
  may then perform actions as the logged-on user. This use case detects the usage
  of Invoke-DCOM PowerShell script to remotely obtain arbitrary and direct shellcode
  execution through Office applications as well as other Windows objects that contain
  insecure methods. Note: PowerShell logging is recommended for best detection. Detection
  using other log sources is dependent on commands being run in manner that creates
  a new process, such as powershell -c.'
