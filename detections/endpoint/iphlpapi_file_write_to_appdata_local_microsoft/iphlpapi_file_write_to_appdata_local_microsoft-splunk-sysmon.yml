title: iphlpapi.dll File Write to Appdata_Local_Microsoft
description: Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading
  DLLs. Similar to DLL Search Order Hijacking, side-loading involves hijacking which
  DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order
  of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries
  may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application
  that executes their payload(s). Researchers have reported that malicious documents
  can use DLL sideloading using Teams or OneDrive to establish C&C. This use case
  iphlpapi.dll file writes in a subfolder under the AppData\Local\Microsoft path,
  indicating potential abuse of Microsoft applications to sideload malicious DLLs.
