title: ISO Image Mounted - Windows
description: 'Threat actors such as APT29 have used ISO files to deliver malicious
  code to target systems. Normally, when a file is downloaded from the internet, Windows
  adds a Zone Identifier to identify the file''s origin (known as mark-of-the-web
  or MOTW). Files stored with an ISO do not contain the Zone Identifier Alternate
  Data Stream, enabling MOTW bypass. This use case detects ISO images mounted on Windows
  systems. -- Threat Actor Association: Lazarus -- Atomics T1553.005 Test #1'
