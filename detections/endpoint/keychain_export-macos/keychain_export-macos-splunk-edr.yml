title: Keychain Export - MacOS
description: 'Adversaries may acquire credentials from Keychain. Keychain (or Keychain
  Services) is the macOS credential management system that stores account names, passwords,
  private keys, certificates, sensitive application data, payment data, and secure
  notes. Keychains can be viewed and edited through the Keychain Access application
  or using the command-line utility security. This use case detects commands used
  to access, dump, or export information from keychains. Atomics T1555.001 Test #1'
