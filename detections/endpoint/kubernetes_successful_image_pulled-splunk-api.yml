title: Kubernetes Successful Image Pulled
description: Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate
  execution or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container
  to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes
  that execute or download malware. This use case looks for when an image has been
  successfully pulled when a pod is created.
