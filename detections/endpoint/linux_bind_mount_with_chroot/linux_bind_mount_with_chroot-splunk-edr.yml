title: Linux Bind Mount with Chroot
description: Threat actors have been observed targeting exposed Docker APIs and using
  chroot to set the root directory to /mnt (typically used for mounting file systems)
  before executing additional commands. This use case detects commands where chroot
  is used in conjunction with mount commands.

logic: '`get_endpoint_data` `get_endpoint_data_edr` TERM(chroot) (TERM(/mnt) OR TERM(Mount))
  | regex process="(?i)chroot\s+(\/mnt|mount)" | table _time, host, user process,
  process_*, syscall, name | bin span=1s | stats values(*) as * by _time, host '
