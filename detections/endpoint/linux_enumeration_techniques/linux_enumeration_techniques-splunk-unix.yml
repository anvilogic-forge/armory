description: 'Once the attacker has a limited shell it is useful to escalate that
  shell''s privileges. In order to find all kind of information about the system and
  find a way to escalate, the attacker uses multiple scripts that will output information
  like kernel information, current user/group info, users that have previously logged
  onto the system, group memberships, admin users, contents of /etc/passwd, sudo commands
  without password, environment information, cron jobs, network and ip information,
  running processes, interesting files (SUIG, SGID), bash_history etc. Threat Actor
