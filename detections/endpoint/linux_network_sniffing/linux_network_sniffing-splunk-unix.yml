title: Linux Network Sniffing
description: 'An attacker may use a variety of tools to sniff the traffic on the network
  of a compromised machine. This is part of reconnaissance after compromising a system
  in order to gather more information about the network or other potentially vulnerable
  services/servers in order to pivot to them or make lateral movements inside the
  network. Atomic Test T1040 - Test #1'
