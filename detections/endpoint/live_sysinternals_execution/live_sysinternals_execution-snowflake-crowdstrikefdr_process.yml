title: Live Sysinternals Execution
description: Sysinternals utilities are a suite of advanced system utilities aimed
  at managing, troubleshooting, and diagnosing Windows systems and applications. The
  live version of Sysinternals, available from https://live.sysinternals.com, enables
  users to run the tools without having to first download and install them locally.
  Threat actors may leverage these tools for system reconnaissance, privilege escalation,
  or to facilitate lateral movement within a network. This use case detects command
  line invocations of live.sysinternals.com, indicating potential attempts to execute
  Sysinternals tools without installation.
