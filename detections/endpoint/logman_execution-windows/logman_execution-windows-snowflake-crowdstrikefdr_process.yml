title: Logman Execution - Windows
description: Logman is a command-line tool in Windows that manages and schedules performance
  counter and event trace log collections on local and remote systems. Threat actors
  may abuse Logman to manipulate logging settings and disable security monitoring,
  allowing them to conduct malicious activities without detection. This use case detects
  lanman executions with commands to start, stop, delete, update, or query event tracers.
