title: masscan Execution - *nix
description: Masscan is a high-performance, open-source network scanning tool designed
  to scan large ranges of IP addresses for open ports, offering similar functionality
  to Nmap but with significantly faster scanning capabilities. Threat actors may use
  port and vulnerability scanning tools to identify running services and potential
  exploits on remote hosts and network devices. This use case detects masscan executions.
