title: Mega Utility Execution - Windows
description: Mega is a cloud storage service used by many threat actors due to its
  use of end-to-end encryption and semi-anonymous payment options. The client application
  MEGAsync.exe and command-line interface utility MegaCMD allow threat actors to exfiltrate
  large amounts of data. This use case detects process executions of MEGASync or MegaCMD.
