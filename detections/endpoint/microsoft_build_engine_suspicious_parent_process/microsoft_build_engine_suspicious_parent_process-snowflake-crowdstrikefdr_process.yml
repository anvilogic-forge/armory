title: Microsoft Build Engine Suspicious Parent Process
description: Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy
  execution of malicious payloads. There are many utilities used for software development
  related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development,
  debugging, and reverse engineering. These utilities may often be signed with legitimate
  certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious
  code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.
  This use case detects msbuild.exe spawned by a scripting interpreter (such as CMD,
  PowerShell, etc.).
