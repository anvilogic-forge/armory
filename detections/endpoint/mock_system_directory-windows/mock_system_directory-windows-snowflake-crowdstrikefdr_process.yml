title: Mock System Directory - Windows
description: A Windows User Account Control Bypass technique is capable of achieving
  privilege escalation without displaying a UAC prompt. This method involves creating
  a mock directory with a trailing whitespace and the same name as a legitmate trusted
  location (e.g. "C:\Windows \System32\") and copying required files to it. The mock
  directory can not be created via Windows Explorer, requiring the attacker to create
  it via scripting or command line. This use case detects process or parent process
  file paths (where available depending on log source) for trusted system directories
  (\Windows\system32 or Program Files) including a trailing space before \.
logic_format: snowflake
logic: 'select * from crowdstrikefdr_process where event_time > dateadd(hour, -2,
  sysdate()) and event_platform ilike ''%Win%'' and (process_path ilike ''%Windows
  %'' or process_path ilike ''%Program Files %'') and regexp_like(process_path, ''.*\\\s+\\\x5c.*'',
  ''i'') '
