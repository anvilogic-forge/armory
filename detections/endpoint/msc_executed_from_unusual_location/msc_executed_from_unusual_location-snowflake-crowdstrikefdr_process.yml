title: .msc Executed from Unusual Location
description: 'Threat actors may abuse mmc.exe to proxy execution of malicious .msc
  files. Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a binary that may be signed by Microsoft
  and is used in several ways in either its GUI or in a command prompt. MMC can be
  used to create, open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools
  created by Microsoft, called snap-ins. These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows
  systems locally or remotely. MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc
  files to manage system configuration. This use case detects mmc.exe executions referencing
  .msc files outside of C:\Windows\system32 or C:\Windows\SysWOW64. '
