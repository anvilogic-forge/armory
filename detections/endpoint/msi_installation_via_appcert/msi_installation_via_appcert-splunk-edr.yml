title: MSI Installation via Appcert
description: An MSI file is a Microsoft Installer package used for installing software
  on Windows systems. Typically, .msi files are installed by msiexec.exe; AppCert.exe
  is a component of the Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit used primarily for
  application compatibility testing and can be used to install MSI files, but this
  is not normal usage for appcert. Threat actors may use appcert to install malicious
  MSI files in an attempt to evade detection. This use case detects appcert executions
  with commands to install an msi file. Living Off the Land Binary and Scripts (LOLBAS)
