description: Ngrok is a legitimate reverse proxy tool that can create a secure tunnel
  to servers located behind firewalls or on local machines that do not have a public
  IP. Ngrok has been leveraged by threat actors in several campaigns including use
  for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
