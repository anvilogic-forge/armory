title: ngrok Execution - Windows
description: 'Ngrok is a legitimate reverse proxy tool that can create a secure tunnel
  to servers located behind firewalls or on local machines that do not have a public
  IP. Ngrok has been leveraged by threat actors in several campaigns including use
  for lateral movement and data exfiltration. This use case detects process creation
  events for ngrok.exe or command patterns likely to be unique to ngrok in the event
  of a renamed executable. -- Threat Actor Association: Scattered Spider (aka. Muddled
  Libra, Scatter Swine, Starfraud, UNC3944)'
