title: NirCmd Execution
description: 'NirCmd is a command line utility with capabilities to delete files from
  Recycling Bin, delete registry keys, take screenshots and execute command without
  displaying a user interface. While it has legitimate administrative uses, threat
  actors including Mint Sandstorm aka PHOSPHORUS have been observed using renamed
  NirCmd to execute malicious code. This use case detects executions of NirCmd.exe
  or command line argument patterns consistent with abusive activities observed with
  NirCmd, accounting for instances where it has been renamed. Allowlisting is recommended
  for executables using the same command line arguments for best results. '
