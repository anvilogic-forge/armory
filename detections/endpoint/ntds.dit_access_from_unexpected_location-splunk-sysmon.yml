title: ntds.dit Access from Unexpected Location
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to access or create a copy of the Active Directory
  domain database in order to steal credential information, as well as obtain other
  information about domain members such as devices, users, and access rights. This
  use case detects processes and parent processes interacting with ntds.dit from unexpected
  locations which may indicate malicious activity. Due to limitations in EDR logging,
  EDR rules will only detect on process path (not parent process path). -- Threat
