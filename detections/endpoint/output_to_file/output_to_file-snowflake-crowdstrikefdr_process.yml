description: 'Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory
  on the local system prior to Exfiltration. This use case looks for indicators of
  commands being saved to a file such as "&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;". Typically a new process
  is not created when executed from a command prompt, however adversaries may output
  process results to a txt document during discovery. -- Threat Actor Association:
