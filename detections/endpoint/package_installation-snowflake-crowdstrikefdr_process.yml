title: Package installation
description: 'Some programming languages, like Python, come with an easy, more or
  less official method of installing dependencies for your projects. These installers
  are usually tied to public code repositories where anyone can freely upload code
  packages for others to use. The intent of this use case is to identify installation
  of packages, with common repositories using pip, gem and npm. Use case will be used
  to with additional threat identifiers to potentially identify Dependency confusion
  style attacks. '
