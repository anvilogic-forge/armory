title: Password Validation Check via DSCL from Uncommon Process - macOS
description: Threat actors targeting macOS systems, such as those using Atomic Stealer,
  may abuse the dscl command with the authonly option to silently test for valid local
  credentials. This technique enables actors to verify password correctness without
  logging in, aiding credential validation, privilege escalation, or account enumeration.
  This use case detects instances where dscl authonly is executed from shell or AppleScript-based
  processes, indicating potential misuse of macOS directory services for credential
  testing.
