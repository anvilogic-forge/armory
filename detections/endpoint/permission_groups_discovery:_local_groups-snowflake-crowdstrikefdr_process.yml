title: 'Permission Groups Discovery: Local Groups'
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.
  The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which

  information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users
  found within the local administrators group. Atomics T1069.001 Test #3 Atomics T1069.001
