title: 'Permission Groups Discovery: Domain Groups'
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to find domain-level groups and permission settings.
  The knowledge of domain-level permission groups can help adversaries determine which
  groups exist and which users belong to a particular group. Adversaries may use this
  information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as domain administrators.
