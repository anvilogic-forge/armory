title: 'Permission Groups Discovery: Local Groups'
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.
  The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which
  groups exist and which users belong to a particular group. Adversaries may use this
  information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users
  found within the local administrators group. Atomics T1069.001 Test #3 Atomics T1069.001
