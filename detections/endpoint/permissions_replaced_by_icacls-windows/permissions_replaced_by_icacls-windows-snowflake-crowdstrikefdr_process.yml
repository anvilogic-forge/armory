title: Permissions Replaced by icacls - Windows
description: 'icacls is a command-line utility in Windows that allows for viewing
  and modifying Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs) and file permissions. Threat
  actors may abuse this tool to alter file permissions, potentially gaining unauthorized
  access or control over sensitive files and directories, as observed by DFIR report
  (see references). This use case detects icacls executions with switches to replace
  permissions. -- Threat Actor Association: FIN7 (aka. Carbon Spider, Sangria Tempest)'
