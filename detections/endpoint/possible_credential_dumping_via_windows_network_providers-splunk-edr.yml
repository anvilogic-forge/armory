title: Possible Credential Dumping via Windows Network Providers
description: 'A Network Provider is a Windows component that facilitates the connection,
  communication, and resource sharing between a system and a network. Threat actors
  can create a rogue Network Provider to capture or "dump" credentials by intercepting
  and logging network authentication requests, such as NPPSpy. This use case detects
  modifications to registry values for Network Providers. Atomics T1003 Test #2'
