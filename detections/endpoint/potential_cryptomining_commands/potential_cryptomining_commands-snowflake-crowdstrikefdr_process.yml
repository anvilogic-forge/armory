title: Potential Cryptomining Commands
description: Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems in order to
  solve resource intensive problems, which may impact system and/or hosted service
  availability. One common purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions
  of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency. This use case detects common
  plaintext and base64 encoded commands for cryptomining activity.
