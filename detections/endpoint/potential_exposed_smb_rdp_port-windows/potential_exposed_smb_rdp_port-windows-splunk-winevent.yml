title: Potential Exposed SMB_RDP Port - Windows
description: Threat actors may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing
  host or system to initially access a network. The weakness in the system can be
  a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration. This use case detects
  successful network logon events (event 4624, Type 3) events with an external source
  IP, which indicates that logon events are being attempted from external IPs.
