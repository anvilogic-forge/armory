title: Potential fodhelper UAC Bypass Attempt
description: 'Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges
  on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges
  (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level
  permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. This use case detects
  the creation of registry keys associated with known methods of using fodhelper to
  bypass UAC. Atomic Test #3: T1548.002'
