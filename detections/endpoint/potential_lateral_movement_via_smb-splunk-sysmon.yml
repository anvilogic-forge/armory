title: Potential Lateral Movement via SMB
description: 'Adversaries, typically, start moving laterally once they get initial
  foothold in the victim organization. Once they get initial access, they escalate
  their privileges and move laterally with the escalated privileges either to propagate
  their malware or to further reconnaissance & collect the targeted information. There
  are many techniques by which threat actors move laterally, this use case focuses
  solely on detecting potential anomalous SMB Traffic. - Threat Actor Association:
  Earth Estries, FIN8 (Syssphinx), Lancefly, Lazarus - Software Association: ALPHV/BlackCat,
  Ransom Cartel'
