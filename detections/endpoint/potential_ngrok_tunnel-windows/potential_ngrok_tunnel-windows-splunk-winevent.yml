description: 'ngrok is a reverse proxy utility with the ability to establish tunnels
  on targets using reverse SSH, even if the target does not have ngrok installed.

  lateral movement on compromised targets by exposing RDP services. This use case
  detects artifacts specific to RDP sessions established using ngrok. -- Threat Actor
