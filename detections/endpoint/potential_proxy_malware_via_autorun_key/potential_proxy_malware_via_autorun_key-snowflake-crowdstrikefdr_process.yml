title: Potential Proxy Malware via AutoRun Key
description: The Windows Registry Run keys can be abused to establish persistence
  for malware known as SystemBC (aka Coroxy or DroxiDat), which functions as a proxy,
  bot, backdoor, and RAT. Threat actors utilize this method to maintain continuous
  access to a compromised system, enabling them to gather information, execute commands,
  and deploy additional malware. SystemBC has been observed modifying AutoRun keys
  with a value of socks5. This use case detects modifications to registry keys containing
  the path \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run including the value "socks5".
