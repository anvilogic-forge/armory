title: Potential SMB Activity from External IP - Windows
description: Threat actors may scan for hosts with SMB ports exposed to the internet
  and attempt to access services. This rule detects external attempts to access SMB
  shares (Event IDs 5140 or 5145) following network logons (Event ID 4624, Logon Type
  3) within a one minute period correlated by host and user, which may indicate a
  threat actor's initial access attempt via SMB.
