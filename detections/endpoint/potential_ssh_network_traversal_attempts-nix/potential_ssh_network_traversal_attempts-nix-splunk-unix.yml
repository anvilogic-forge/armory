title: Potential SSH Network Traversal Attempts - *nix
description: 'SSH-Snake is a powerful tool designed to perform automatic network traversal
  using SSH private keys discovered on systems, with the objective of creating a comprehensive
  map of a network and its dependencies, identifying to what extent a network can
  be compromised using SSH and SSH private keys starting from a particular system.
  SSH-Snake can automatically reveal the relationship between systems which are connected
  via SSH, which would normally take a tremendous amount of time and effort to perform
  manually. This use case detects SSH key exchange activity across the network with
  multiple target hosts (default: more than two unique hosts) within a 5 minute period,
  which may indicate the use of SSH-Snake or similar tools.'
