title: Potential Sysinternals Tool Execution
description: 'Sysinternals is a widely-used set of utilities for endpoint management,
  troubleshooting, and monitoring and is available for free from Microsoft. While
  not installed by default, it can be considered a LOLBAS due to its ubiquity in enterprise
  environments. Threat actors can abuse these utilities in a variety of ways including
  information gathering, remote command execution, memory dumping, and many more.
  This use case detects command line executions including the accepteula flag. The
  names of individual SysInternal tools have not been included to account for instances
  where the process has been renamed. Allowlisting by process path for known benign
  executables using -accepteula or /accepteula combined with usernames expected to
  use Sysinternals is recommended to reduce false positives. -- Threat Actor Association:
  Cluster Alpha (STAC1248) - Software Association: Fog -- LOLBINS/LOLBAS'
