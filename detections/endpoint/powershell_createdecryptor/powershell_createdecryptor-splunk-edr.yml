title: PowerShell CreateDecryptor
description: Threat actors may abuse the CreateDecryptor() method within PowerShell
  scripts to dynamically decrypt embedded payloads, configuration files, or sensitive
  data at runtime. CreateDecryptor() is part of legitimate .NET cryptographic operations,
  but its presence in PowerShell ScriptBlock or CommandLine activity — especially
  outside normal application behavior — often signals malware unpacking, fileless
  attacks, or ransomware staging. This use case detects references to CreateDecryptor
  in PowerShell activity, potentially indicating obfuscated payload execution or preparation
  for in-memory attacks.
