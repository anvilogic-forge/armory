title: Powershell DLL_EXE Injection
description: 'DLL injection simply refers to the (forced) injection of a DLL into
  the space of another process and then execution of its code.What makes Reflective
  DLL Injection different? The DLL injection code and the source of the DLL are obtained
  via its full path on disk. Because of this, it is not considered a very stealthy
  approach and also has an external dependency which may be problematic should it
  ever be separated. These issues can be addressed by using Reflective DLL Injection
  which allows the sourcing of the DLL in the form of its raw data. Threat Actor Association:
