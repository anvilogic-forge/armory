title: PowerShell Downgrade
description: 'Adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may
  be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls such
  as logging. For example, PowerShell versions 5+ includes Script Block Logging (SBL)
  which can record executed script content. However, adversaries may attempt to execute
  a previous version of PowerShell that does not support SBL with the intent to impair
  defenses while running malicious scripts that may have otherwise been detected.
  This use case detects attempts to execute PowerShell commands using a version earlier
  than 7. -- Threat Actor Association: Earth Estries -- Atomics T1059.001 Test #12'
