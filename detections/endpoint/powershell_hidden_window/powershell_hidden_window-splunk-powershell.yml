title: PowerShell Hidden Window
description: 'Threat actors may attempt to conceal their activity involving PowerShell
  windows by setting the WindowStyle parameter to hidden. While legitimate administrative
  tasks may use hidden windows to perform maintainence tasks in the background, this
  technique can be used by threat actors to evade user suspicion and reduce the likelihood
  of detection. This use case detects PowerShell executions involving hidden window
  commands. PowerShell logging is recommended for detection; process creation logs
  will only detect this activity if the command is executed in a manner that creates
  a new process, such as powershell -c. Atomic Test T1564.003 - Test #1'
