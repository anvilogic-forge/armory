title: Process Connection to Mega - Windows
description: Mega is a cloud storage service used by many threat actors due to its
  use of end-to-end encryption and semi-anonymous payment options. The client application
  MEGAsync.exe and command-line interface utility MegaCMD allow threat actors to exfiltrate
  large amounts of data. This use case detects network connections involving MEGASync.exe
  or MegaCMD or network connections to mega.co.nz or mega.nz (Sysmon only).
