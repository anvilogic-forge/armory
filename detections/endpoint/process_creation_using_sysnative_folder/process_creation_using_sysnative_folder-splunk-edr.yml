title: Process Creation Using Sysnative Folder
description: 'Threat actors may use tools spawning processes from the Sysnative folder
  in an attempt to bypass the File System Redirector on 64-bit versions of Windows
  to execute 32-bit applications from the 64-bit system directory. This use cased
  detects instances where the Sysnative folder is used during process creation, a
  tactic often associated with CobaltStrike activities. Note: Sysnative is often referenced
  by legitimate processes. Allowlisting known processes is recommended to reduce false
  positives.'
