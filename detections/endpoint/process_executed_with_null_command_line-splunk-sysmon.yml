title: Process Executed with Null Command Line
description: Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based
  defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of
  executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running
  code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory,
  system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process
  injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is
  masked under a legitimate process. For some Windows processes, execution with a
  null command line is not expected activity and may be an indication of process injection.
