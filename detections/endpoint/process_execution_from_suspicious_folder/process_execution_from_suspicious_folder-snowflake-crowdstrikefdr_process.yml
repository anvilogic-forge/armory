title: Process Execution From Suspicious Folder
description: Threat actors may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to
  make them appear legitimate or benign to users and security tools. Masquerading
  involves altering the name or location of an object, whether legitimate or malicious,
  to evade defenses and avoid detection. This technique can include modifying file
  metadata, misleading users about the file type, and using names that resemble legitimate
  tasks or services. This use case detects processes executed from a suspicious folder.
