title: Proxy Execution via Appcert
description: Threat actors may exploit legitimate developer utilities to execute malicious
  payloads by proxy. One such utility is appcert.exe, a command-line tool included
  in the Windows Application Certification Kit, which is typically used to verify
  the compliance of Windows applications with Microsoft's certification standards.
  This use case detects appcert executions with commands to proxy execution of another
  binary. Living Off the Land Binary and Scripts (LOLBAS) (LOLBIN)
