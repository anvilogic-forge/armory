title: QEMU Network Tunneling - Windows
description: 'QEMU is an open-source machine emulator that allows for running multiple
  operating systems as separate processes. The use of QEMU executions with specific
  networking commands may indicate attempts at network tunneling or bypassing security
  controls, which was observed in intrusion reported on SecureList. This use case
  detects QEMU executions with command-line arguments that could be used to tunnel
  traffic. '
