title: RC Scripts - Linux
description: 'Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which
  are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup. Adversaries can establish persistence
  by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to rc.local, rc.common, and
  other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution. Upon reboot, the system
  executes the script''s contents as root, resulting in persistence. Note: Several
  Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This
  is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of Launchd. To maintain backwards
  compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they
  exist with the correct file permissions. This use case detects modifications to
  rc.common and rc.local. -- Threat Actor Association: Winnti Group - Software Association:
