title: RDP File Executed from Outlook Temp Directory
description: Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a
  user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface
  on a remote system. Targeted spear-phishing campaigns attributed to Russiaâ€™s APT29
  have been observed distributing .rdp files to victims to initiate a remote connection.
  This use case detects the execution of .rdp files in the temporary directory that
  Outlook uses when opening attachments.
