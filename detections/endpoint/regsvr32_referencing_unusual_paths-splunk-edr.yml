title: regsvr32 Referencing Unusual Paths
description: Adversaries may abuse regsvr32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code.
  regsvr32 is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking
  and embedding controls including .dlls. This use case detects executions of regsvr32
  involving frequently abused file paths as observed with the DarkWatchMan remote
  access trojan. Applications with normal use from AppData\Local should be whitelisted
  using the full file path. LOLBAS/LOLBINS
