title: Remote Access Software Execution
description: 'Remote access tools are commonly used as legitimate technical support
  software and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.
  Adversaries may install and use these tools post-compromise as alternate communications
  channels for redundant access or as a way to establish an interactive remote desktop
  session with the target system. They may also be used as a component of malware
  to establish a reverse connection or back-connect to a service or adversary controlled
  system. Installation of many remote access tools may also include persistence (ex:
  the tool''s installation routine creates a Windows Service). This use case detects
  the execution of remote access software known to be used by threat actors. - Threat
