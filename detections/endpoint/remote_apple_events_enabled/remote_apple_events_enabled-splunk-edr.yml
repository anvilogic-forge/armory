title: Remote Apple Events Enabled
description: 'Remote Apple Events (RAE) is part of the Apple Event Manager framework,
  enabling macOS applications to communicate and execute tasks over a network using
  Apple Events. Applications expose specific functions by registering handlers via
  the Apple Events API. Remote clients can invoke these handlers using event identifiers,
  allowing automated or remote control of applications across systems. Full disk access
  is required to successfully enable Remote Apple Events. This use case detects commands
  to enable Remote Apple Events using systemsetup. '
