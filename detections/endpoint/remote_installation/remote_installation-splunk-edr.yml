title: Remote .msi Installation
description: 'Adversaries may abuse msiexec.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
  Msiexec.exe is the command-line utility for the Windows Installer and is thus commonly
  associated with executing installation packages (.msi). The Msiexec.exe binary may
  also be digitally signed by Microsoft. This use case detects attempts to install
  .msi from remote locations. -- Threat Actor Association: APT-K-47/Mysterious Elephant
