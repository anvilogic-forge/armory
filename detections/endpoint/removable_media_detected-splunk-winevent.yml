title: Removable Media Detected
description: 'Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or
  air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage
  of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the
  case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files
  stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate
  file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial
  Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of
  systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media''s firmware
  itself. - Threat Actor Association: APT28, APT29, Camaro Dragon, FIN7, Gamaredon
  Group/Shuckworm, UNC4990 - Software Association: Raspberry Robin'
