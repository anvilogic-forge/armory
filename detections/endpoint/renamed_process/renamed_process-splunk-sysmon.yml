title: Renamed Process
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to
  make them appear legitimate or benign to users and/or security tools. Masquerading
  occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated
  or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating
  file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate
  task or service names. This use case compares the process'' original file name to
  the process name at execution. Some legitimate processes may be renamed in normal
  operation and should be allowlisted by file name, process path, and commands where
  applicable to reduce false positives. This detection is based on features unique
  to SysMon and therefore requires SysMon 10.0 or later. -- Threat Actor Association:
