title: rundll32.exe Executing DLL from Non-standard Directory
description: rundll32.exe is a legitimate Windows utility used to run functions stored
  in Dynamic Link Libraries. Because rundll32 is a trusted system utility with the
  ability to execute code, it is a high value target for abuse by threat actors. Threat
  actors leveraging Qbot malware have been observed dropping DLLs into writeable paths
  and calling them with rundll32.exe. This use case detects when a DLL in a nonstandard
  directory is called by rundll32. Living Off the Land Binary and Scripts (LOLBAS)
