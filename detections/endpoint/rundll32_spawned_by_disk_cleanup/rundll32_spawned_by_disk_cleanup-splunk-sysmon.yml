title: Rundll32 Spawned by Disk Cleanup
description: The Windows Disk Cleanup utility is a legacy tool designed to delete
  cache and temporary files to improve system performance and free up hard disk space.
  It is possible to abuse the utility to establish persistence by executing arbitrary
  code when Disk Cleanup is initiated via COM hijacking. This use case detects rundll32.exe
  processes launched by CleanMgr.exe (Disk Cleanup binary), indicating potential COM
  hijacking has taken place. Living Off the Land Binary and Scripts (LOLBAS) (LOLBIN)
