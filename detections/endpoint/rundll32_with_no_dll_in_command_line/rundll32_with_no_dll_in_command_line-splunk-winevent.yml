title: rundll32 with No DLL in Command Line
description: rundll32.exe is a legitimate Windows utility used to run functions stored
  in Dynamic Link Libraries. Typical usage would involve specifying a DLL file and
  a function to execute. Because rundll32 is a trusted system utility with the ability
  to execute code, it is a high value target for abuse by threat actors. This use
  case detects executions of rundll32.exe without a .dll referenced in the command
  line. Benign false positives from Internet Explorer parent processes have been filtered
  out. Living Off the Land Binary and Scripts (LOLBAS) (LOLBIN)
