title: Scheduled Task with Potential SSH Tunnel - Windows
description: Threat actors have been observed using scheduled tasks to create reverse
  SSH tunnels to facilitate persistence on a compromised machine as reported by DFIR.
  This use case detects scheduled tasks created with commands indicating potential
  SSH tunnels. The regex filtering matches on the patterns <user>@<IP address> and
  <port number>:<IP Address> :<port number>. Living Off the Land Binary and Scripts
