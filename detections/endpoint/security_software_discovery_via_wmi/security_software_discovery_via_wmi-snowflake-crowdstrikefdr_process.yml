title: Security Software Discovery via WMI
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations,
  defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment.
  This may include things such as firewall rules and anti-virus. Adversaries may use
  the information from Security Software Discovery during automated discovery to shape
  follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target
  and/or attempts specific actions. This use case detects enumeration commands for
  antivirus software using WMI. Atomics Test T1518.001 Test #6'
