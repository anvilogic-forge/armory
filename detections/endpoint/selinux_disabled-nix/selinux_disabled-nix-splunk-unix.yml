title: SELinux Disabled - *nix
description: Adversaries may modify and/or disable security tools to avoid possible
  detection of their malware/tools and activities. This may take many forms, such
  as killing security software processes or services, modifying / deleting Registry
  keys or configuration files so that tools do not operate properly, or other methods
  to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information. Adversaries
  may also disable updates to prevent the latest security patches from reaching tools
  on victim systems. This use case detects when the setenforce command was used to
  disable SELinux, a security module integrated into the Linux kernel that enforces
  mandatory access control (MAC) policies.
