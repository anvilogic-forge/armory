description: 'Sharphound can be used to collect Active Directory information in order
  to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible
  to quickly identify. Once collected information can be utilized by BloodHound to
  apply graph theory in order to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships
  within an Active Directory environment. -- Threat Actor Association: APT29/Nobelium/Cozy
