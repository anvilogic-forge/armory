title: Shell Configuration Modified - *nix
description: 'Adversaries can gain persistence by executing malicious commands via
  a userâ€™s shell, taking advantage of Unix Shell''s feature that runs configuration
  scripts during different stages of a session. They insert malicious commands into
  scripts that are automatically executed by shells such as /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d
  (requiring root permissions), or /.bash_profile, /.bash_login, or /.profile (for
  user level permissions), which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface
  or connects remotely. Additionally, malware can use the /.bash_logout file to trigger
  execution at the end of a session, providing another avenue for persistence. This
  use case detects attempts to modify shell configuration files. If echo is used to
  make the modification, bash history logging is recommended for best detection. Atomics
