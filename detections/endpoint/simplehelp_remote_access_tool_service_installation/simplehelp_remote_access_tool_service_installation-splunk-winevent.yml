title: SimpleHelp Remote Access Tool Service Installation
description: 'Threat actors may install remote access tools (RATs) as Windows services
  to maintain persistent access to compromised systems. Tools like SimpleHelp or JWrapper
  Remote Access are often abused for stealthy remote control, masquerading as legitimate
  IT support tools. This use case detects the installation of Windows services (event
  codes 4697 or 7045) where the service binary path matches known patterns associated
  with SimpleHelp, JWrapper Remote Access, or similarly named executables, indicating
  potential unauthorized remote access setup. - Windows Security event 4697: The minimum
  OS version is Server 2016 or Windows 10. Windows Server event 7045: Windows Server
  2008 R2 and 7, Windows Server 2012 R2 and 8.1, Windows Server 2016 and 10 - LOLRMM'
