title: SMB Write Access on Administrative Share
description: SMB is a Windows file and printer sharing protocol. Threat actors may
  use SMB to connect to shared drives when moving laterally. An administrative share
  is a network share created by default on Windows systems for administrative purposes,
  allowing privileged users remote access to system resources, typically hidden from
  regular network users (denoted by $). Domain controllers may have administrative
  shares NETLOGON or SYSVOL. This use case detects SMB access attempts targeting Administrative
  shares with write access masks (0x2) from non-system accounts.
