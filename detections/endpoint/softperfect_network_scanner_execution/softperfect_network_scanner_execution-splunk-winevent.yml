title: SoftPerfect Network Scanner Execution
description: 'SoftPerfect Network Scanner is a free port scanner that can be run without
  installation. Due to its portability, it is an attractive tool for threat actors
  during post-compromise discovery activities as reported by DFIR. This use case detects
  executions of netscan.exe, netscan32.exe, or netscan64.exe. While the tool itself
  is not considered malicious, unexpected use should be investigated as it may indicate
  unauthorized discovery activity. -- Software Association: Akira'
