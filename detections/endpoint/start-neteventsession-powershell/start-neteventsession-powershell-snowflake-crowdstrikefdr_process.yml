title: Start-NetEventSession - PowerShell
description: 'The PowerShell cmdlet Start-NetEventSession allows an attacker to start
  event and packet capture for a network session. Adversaries may attempt to capture
  network to gather information over the course of an operation. Data captured via
  this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure,
  unencrypted protocol. This use case detects the execution of PowerShell scripts
  or commands using the Start-NetEventSession cmdlet. Note: PowerShell logging is
  recommended for best detection. Detection using other log sources is dependent on
  commands being run in manner that creates a new process, such as powershell -command.'
