title: Stored Credentials from Web Browsers - *nix
description: 'Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files
  specific to the target browser. Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website
  usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future.
  Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential
  store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.
  After acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle
  the credentials across different systems and/or accounts in order to expand access.
  This can result in significantly furthering an adversary''s objective in cases where
  credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain
  administrator). This use case detects attempts to enumerate or access files containing
  stored credentials from web browsers on Linux and MacOS endpoints. Atomic T1555.003
