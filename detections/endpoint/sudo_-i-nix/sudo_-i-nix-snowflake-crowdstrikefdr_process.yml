title: sudo -i - *nix
description: 'Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution.
  Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many
  variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific
  OS or distribution. Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain
  commands requiring elevated privileges. This use case detects the execution of sudo
  -i on a system. Note: default auditd logging will not log these events. Either process
  command logging via EDR, bash history, or custom auditd rules are required for detection.'
