title: Suspicious AteraAgent Installation - Windows
description: An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software
  to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within
  networks. These remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, such as AteraAgent,
  are commonly used as legitimate technical support software and may be allowed by
  application control within a target environment. Remote access software may be installed
  and used post-compromise as an alternate communications channel for redundant access
  or as a way to establish an interactive remote desktop session with the target system.
  They may also be used as a component of malware to establish a reverse connection
  or back-connect to a service or adversary controlled system. This use case detects
  installation of AteraAgent RMM with an IntegratorLogin from non-business email providers.
  In lieu of filtering for specific publicly available mail providers, a negative
  match for expected user email domains can be used.
