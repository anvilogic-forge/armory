title: Suspicious Confluence Child Process - Windows
description: 'Threat actors may target vulnerabilities in Confluence to gain initial
  access and then spawn command-line utilities from Confluence processes. This allows
  them to download malicious payloads or execute arbitrary commands on the compromised
  system, potentially leading to full system control or further lateral movement within
  the network. This use case detects when Confluence processes launch command-line
  utilities, potentially indicating that a threat actor has gained initial access
  through Confluence vulnerabilities such as CVE-2023-22527 or CVE-2023-22518. Note:
  logging of the full parent process file path is required for detection.'
