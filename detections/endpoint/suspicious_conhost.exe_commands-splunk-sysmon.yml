description: 'Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to
  bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. This
  use case detects commands using conhost.exe to launch other executables, which may
  be used by adversaries to evade detection and bypass restrictions. -- Software Association:
  Qakbot -- Atomics T1202 Test #3'
