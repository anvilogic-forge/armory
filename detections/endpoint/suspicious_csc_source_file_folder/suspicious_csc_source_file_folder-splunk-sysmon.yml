title: Suspicious csc.exe Source File Folder
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze
  by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code. Text-based source code files
  may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries.
  These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities
  such as csc.exe or GCC/MinGW. This use case detects csc.exe executions compiling
  a .cs file from a suspicious folder. Note: Due to its extended logging capabilities
  on parent process information, Sysmon is recommended for best fidelity. -- Threat
