title: Suspicious cupsd Child Process - *nix
description: This use case detects unusual cupsd child processes. Expected child processes
  of cupsd typically include backend processes such as /usr/lib/cups/backend/usb,
  filter processes like /usr/lib/cups/filter/gstoraster, and scheduler-related tasks
  involved in managing print jobs and converting formats for printers. Unusual and
  suspicious child processes of cupsd would include shell processes like /bin/bash,
  network utilities such as curl or wget, or any processes unrelated to printing tasks,
  indicating potential command execution or lateral movement. -- CVE-2024-47176 CVE-2024-47076
