title: Suspicious Execution of Accessibility Tool Debuggers
description: Threat actors may establish persistence or elevate privileges by executing
  malicious content through accessibility features. Windows accessibility features
  can be launched with a key combination before user login, such as from the Windows
  logon screen. Threat actors can modify the launch process of these programs to gain
  a command prompt or backdoor access without logging into the system. This use case
  detects the execution of accessibility tools by a debugger process, which can indicate
  an attempt to gain unauthorized access or persistence through malicious use of these
  tools.
