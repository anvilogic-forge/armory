title: Suspicious Execution via Microsoft Common Console
description: 'Microsoft Management Console (MMC) can be used to create, open, and
  save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created by Microsoft, called
  snap-ins. These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems locally or remotely.
  MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files to manage system configuration.
  Threat actors may leverage malicious .msc files to gain full code execution via
  mmc.exe as observed in the GrimResource technique. This use case child processes
  created by mmc.exe that do not originate from common system directories or standard
  application paths. NOTE: Due to its extended logging capabilities for parent process
  behaviors and attributes, Sysmon is recommended for best rule fidelity.'
