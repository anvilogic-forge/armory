title: Suspicious InprocServer32 Registry Modification
description: The Windows Disk Cleanup utility is a legacy tool designed to delete
  cache and temporary files to improve system performance and free up hard disk space.
  Threat actors may insert a malicious DLL path into the registry key for the Disk
  Cleanup Scheduled Task, ensuring that their code is executed whenever Disk Cleanup
  runs, thus maintaining persistence on the compromised system without immediate detection.
  This use case detects commands to edit Disk Cleanup registry keys to include DLLs.
