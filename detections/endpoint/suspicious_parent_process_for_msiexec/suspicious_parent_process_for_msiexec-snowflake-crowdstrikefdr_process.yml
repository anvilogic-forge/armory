title: Suspicious Parent Process for msiexec.exe
description: msiexec.exe is a Windows system component used to install and modify
  software packages using Windows Installer. Threat actors may abuse msiexec.exe to
  install malicious software or execute scripts, leveraging its legitimate appearance
  to bypass security measures and gain persistence on a targeted system as observed
  in FlawedGrace attacks. This use case detects executions of msiexec.exe with suspicious
  parent processes. Living Off the Land Binary and Scripts (LOLBAS) (LOLBIN)
