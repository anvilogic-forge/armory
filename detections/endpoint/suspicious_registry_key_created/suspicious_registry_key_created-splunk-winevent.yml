title: Suspicious Registry Key Created
description: 'Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program or referencing
  it with a Registry run key or by utilizing content triggered by Image File Execution
  Options (IFEO) debugger keys. Run keys may exist under multiple hives and IFEOs
  can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program
  silently exits. Multiple APTs leverage these Hives in order to establish persistence
  or execute additional payloads that appear to blend in with normal traffic. -- Threat
