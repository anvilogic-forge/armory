title: Suspicious .sys Created - Windows
description: Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine
  so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode. This
  process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD). Adversaries
  may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or
  download it to a compromised system via Ingress Tool Transfer or Lateral Tool Transfer.
  This use case detects rare file creation events for .sys files.
