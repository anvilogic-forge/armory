title: Swift Script Execution - MacOS
description: Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands,
  scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting
  with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms.
  Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing
  arbitrary commands. This use case detects Swift scripts executed from the command
  line.
