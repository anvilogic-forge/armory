title: System Binary Moved - *nix
description: 'Adversaries may rename legitimate system utilities to try to evade security
  mechanisms concerning the usage of those utilities. Security monitoring and control
  mechanisms may be in place for system utilities adversaries are capable of abusing.
  It may be possible to bypass those security mechanisms by renaming the utility prior
  to utilization (ex: rename rundll32.exe). An alternative case occurs when a legitimate
  utility is copied or moved to a different directory and renamed to avoid detection
  based on system utilities executing from non-standard paths. This use case detects
  when binaries in /bin are moved on Unix-based endpoints. This method has been used
  by TeamTNT to rename binaries in order to prevent other malware from using them.'
