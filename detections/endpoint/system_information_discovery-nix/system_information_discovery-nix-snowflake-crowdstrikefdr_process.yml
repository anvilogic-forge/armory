title: System Information Discovery - *nix
description: 'An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating
  system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture.
  Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated
  discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully
  infects the target and/or attempts specific actions. This use case detects several
  system information discovery commands executed in a short period of time (default:
  5m). Atomics T1082 Test #2 Atomics T1082 Test #3 Atomics T1082 Test #7 Atomics T1082
