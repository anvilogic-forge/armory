title: System Owner_User Discovery - Windows
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged
  in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively
  using the system. Adversaries may use the information during automated discovery
  to direct follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects
  the target and/or attempts specific actions. This use case detects when reconnaissance
  commands specifically targeting discovery of system owners and users are executed
  in a short period of time. -- Threat Actor Association: Alloy Taurus/Gallium, APT28/Fancy
