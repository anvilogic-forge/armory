title: Task Manager lsass Dump
description: 'The Windows Task Manager may be used to dump the memory space of lsass.exe
  to disk for processing with a credential access tool such as Mimikatz. This is performed
  by launching Task Manager as a privileged user, selecting lsass.exe, and clicking
  “Create dump file”. This saves a dump file to disk with a deterministic name that
  includes the name of the process being dumped. - Threat Actor Association: APT29/Nobelium,
