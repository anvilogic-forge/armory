title: Temporary ConnectWise xml File Activity
description: ConnectWise ScreenConnect is a popular remote desktop solution. ConnectWise
  released an advisory detailing a critical authentication bypass vulnerability affecting
  ScreenConnect versions prior to 23.9.8. This use case detects when an XML file in
  the \Temp\ScreenConnect\[version number]\ directory has been created, modified,
  or deleted. To enable detection of the file activities associated with the vulnerability,
  configure the Advanced Auditing policy to log successful Windows Event ID 4663 events,
  and set a System Access Control List (SACL) on the target directory to monitor file
  modifications. See Huntress article in references for detailed information.
