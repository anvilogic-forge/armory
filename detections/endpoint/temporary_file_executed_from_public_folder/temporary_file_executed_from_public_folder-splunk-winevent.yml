title: Temporary File Executed from Public Folder
description: 'The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence Team has detailed several
  behaviors of threat actors using the RomCom remote access trojan. One indication
  of unusual activity is the placement of binaries in Temp directories with the extension
  .tmp which are launched by processes stored in the Public folder. This use case
  detects processes executing from temporary directories with parent processes located
  in public folders. -- Threat Actor Association: UNC5812'
