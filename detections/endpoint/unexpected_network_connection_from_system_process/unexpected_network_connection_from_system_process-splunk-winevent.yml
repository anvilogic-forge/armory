title: Unexpected Network Connection from System Process
description: Threat actors may abuse legitimate system processes that typically lack
  network functionality to perform malicious network activity, helping evade detection
  and blend in with normal system behavior. This technique is often associated with
  process injection or masquerading, where code is executed within trusted processes
  to establish command-and-control (C2) channels or exfiltrate data. This use case
  detects instances where non-networking system processes (e.g., conhost.exe, lsass.exe,
  wininit.exe) are observed initiating network connections, which may indicate process
  injection, covert C2 activity, or execution of malicious payloads under trusted
  process names.
