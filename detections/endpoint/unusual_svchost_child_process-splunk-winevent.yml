title: Unusual svchost Child Process
description: 'Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based
  defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of
  executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running
  code in the context of another process may allow access to the process''s memory,
  system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process
  injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is
  masked under a legitimate process. Expected Service Host (svchost.exe) activity
  does not normally include certain child processes. Svchost spawning these child
  processes may be an indication of process injection. -- Threat Actor Association:
