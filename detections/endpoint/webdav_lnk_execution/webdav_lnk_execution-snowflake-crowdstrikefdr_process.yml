title: WebDAV LNK Execution
description: Threat actors often place malicious payloads on remote servers, which
  are then downloaded and executed on the user’s PC using scripts or other methods.
  One type of server attackers can leverage is WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and
  Versioning) — a file transfer protocol built on top of HTTP. Threat actors can exploit
  this technique by creating LNK files that, when accessed through Windows Explorer,
  execute commands or scripts, enabling remote code execution and further malicious
  activities. This use case detects when a LNK file was possibly executed from a WebDAV
  server by a user who might have been tricked into accessing a URL shortcut.
