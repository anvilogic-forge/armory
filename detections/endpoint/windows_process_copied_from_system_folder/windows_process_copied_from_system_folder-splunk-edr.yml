title: Windows Process Copied from System Folder
description: 'Adversaries may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to
  make them appear legitimate or benign to users and/or security tools. Masquerading
  occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated
  or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating
  file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate
  task or service names. Renaming abusable system utilities to evade security monitoring
  is also a form of masquerading. This use case detects copying of files from Windows
  system folders. Note: These events are only detected when a new process is created,
  or if PowerShell logging is enabled and used. -- Software Association: BATLoader,
