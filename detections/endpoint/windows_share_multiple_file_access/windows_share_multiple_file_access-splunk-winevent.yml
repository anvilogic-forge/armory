title: Windows Share Multiple File Access
description: 'SMB is a file, printer, and serial port sharing protocol for Windows
  machines on the same network or domain. Adversaries may use SMB to interact with
  file shares, allowing them to move laterally throughout a network. This use case
  looks for share requests to multiple files types within a short period of time.
