description: 'Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing
  malicious content triggered by a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event

  BumbleBee, TargetCompany, TrailBlazer, Trickbot -- Atomics T1047 Test#7 Atomics
  T1047 Test#8 Atomics T1047 Test#9 -- While this use case can detect the above atomics,
  it is not mapped to its MITRE execution techniques due to adversaries utilizing
  this method of WMI for Privilege-Escalation and Persistence.'
