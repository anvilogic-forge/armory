title: C2 Beaconing
description: 'Attackers tend to deploy command and control (C2) servers in order to
  issue commands to hosts they have compromised within a network. These compromised
  hosts tend to send a beacon out to the C2 server in a periodic basis to see if there
  is any commands to be issued locally. Since this traffic tends to be fairly predictable,
  you can detect a potentially compromised host by identifying this periodic outbound
  traffic. -- Threat Actor Association: Gorgon Group, Magic Hound (APT35, Phosphorus,
  Mint Sandstorm), RedEyes, Wizard Spider -- Software Association: Bazar, Conti, Remcos,
  Trickbot'
