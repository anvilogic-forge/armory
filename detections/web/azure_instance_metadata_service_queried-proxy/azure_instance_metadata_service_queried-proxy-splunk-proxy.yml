title: Azure Instance Metadata Service Queried - Proxy
description: The Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) provides information about
  currently running virtual machine instances and can be used to manage and configure
  virtual machines. This information includes the SKU, storage, network configurations,
  and upcoming maintenance events. Attackers can query the available data to gain
  context on the environment and leverage the information to move laterally. This
  use case detects connections to http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance with the
  header Metadata:true and a status code in the 200s (indicated successful connection).
  Legitimate services within your infrastructure may access the IMDS; validating and
  allowlisting is recommended.
