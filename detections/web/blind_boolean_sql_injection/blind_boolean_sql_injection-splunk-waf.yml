title: Blind_Boolean SQL Injection
description: 'Boolean-based SQL Injection is an inferential SQL Injection technique
  that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the application
  to return a different result depending on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE
  result. Depending on the result, the content within the HTTP response will change,
  or remain the same. This allows an attacker to infer if the payload used returned
  true or false, even though no data from the database is returned. This attack is
  typically slow (especially on large databases) since an attacker would need to enumerate
  a database, character by character. '
