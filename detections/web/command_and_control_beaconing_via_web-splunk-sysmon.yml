title: Command and Control Beaconing via WEB
description: 'Attackers tend to deploy command and control (C2) servers in order to
  issue commands to hosts they have compromised within a network. These compromised
  hosts tend to send a beacon out to the C2 server in a periodic basis to see if there
  is any commands to be issued locally. Since this traffic tends to be fairly predictable,
  you can detect a potentially compromised host by identifying this periodic outbound
  traffic. -- Threat Actor Association: APT29/Nobelium/Cozy Bear, APT37, FIN7, FIN8,
  Mustang Panda, Night Spider, TA551, Wizard Spider, WIRTE -- Software Association:
  Alchimist, AvosLocker, Bazar, BadHatch, Conti, Hafnium, Hancitor, IcedID, QakBot,
