title: mega.nz Traffic
description: 'The website mega.nz (or mega.co.nz) is a cloud storage service that
  allows users to store and share files. Threat actors may abuse Mega.nz for Command
  and Control (C2) by having malware fetch commands, store tools for later download,
  or exfiltrate data by uploading it to the service. This use case detects traffic
  to clbin.com. While traffic to Mega.nz is not inherently malicious, unexpected or
  unusual traffic to this site should be investigated due to its potential for abuse.
