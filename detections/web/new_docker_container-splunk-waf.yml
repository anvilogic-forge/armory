title: New Docker Container
description: 'Detect when a container has been created/started of used an alpine image,
  associated with Doki Malware. The image is not malicious but rather it’s being abused
  to carry out malicious activities. By using an image that contains the curl software,
  curl commands are executed as soon as the container is up and running. The advantage
  of using a publicly available image is the attacker doesn’t need to hide it on Docker
  hub or other hosting solutions. Instead, the attackers can use an existing image
  and run their own logic and malware on top of it. - Threat Actor Association: TeamTNT,
