title: NMAP Port Scan
description: 'Port Scanning is the name for the technique used to identify open ports
  and services available on a network host. It is sometimes utilized by security technicians
  to audit computers for vulnerabilities, however, it is also used by hackers to target
  victims. It can be used to send requests to connect to the targeted computers, and
  then keep track of the ports which appear to be opened, or those that respond to
  the request. -- Threat Actor Association: Alloy Taurus/Gallium'
