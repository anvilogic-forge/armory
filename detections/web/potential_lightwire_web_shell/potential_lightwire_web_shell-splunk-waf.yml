title: Potential LIGHTWIRE Web Shell
description: Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent
  access to systems. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible
  Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network.
  A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface
  on the system that hosts the Web server. LIGHTWIRE is a web shell written in Perl
  CGI that is embedded into a legitimate Secure Connect file to enable arbitrary command
  execution. It has been associated with threat actors exploiting Ivanti vulnerabilities.
