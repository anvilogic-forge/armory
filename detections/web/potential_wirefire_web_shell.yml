title: Potential WIREFIRE Web Shell
description: Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent
  access to systems. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible
  Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network.
  A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface
  on the system that hosts the Web server. WIREFIRE is a web shell written in Python
  that exists as trojanized logic to a component of the Connect Secure appliance.
  WIREFIRE supports downloading files to the compromised device and executing arbitrary
  commands. It has been associated with threat actors exploiting Ivanti vulnerabilities.
