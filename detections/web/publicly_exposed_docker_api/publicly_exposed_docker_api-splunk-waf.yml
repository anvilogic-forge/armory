title: Publicly exposed Docker API
description: 'Docker is a technology that allows you to perform operating system-level
  virtualization. An incredible number of companies and production hosts are running
  Docker to develop, deploy, and run applications inside containers. You can interact
  with Docker via the terminal and also via remote API. The Docker Remote API is a
  great way to control your remote Docker host, including automating the deployment
  process, control and get the state of your containers, and more. With this great
  power comes a great risk — if the control gets into the wrong hands, your entire
  network can be in danger. In February, a new vulnerability (CVE-2019-5736) was discovered
  that allows you to gain host root access from a docker container. The combination
  of this new vulnerability and exposed remote Docker API can lead to a fully compromised
  host. The Docker Remote API listens on ports 2375 / 2376. By default, the remote
  API is only accessible from the loopback interface (“localhost”, “127.0.0.1”), and
  should not be available from external sources. - Threat Actor Association: 8220
